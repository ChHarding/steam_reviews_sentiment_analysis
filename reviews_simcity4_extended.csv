"I played this game a lot when i was 12 or 13 or whatever which explains why i didn't have a girlfriend for a long time but I played it recently and it's still a hell of a lot of fun. I built a city with two motorways going out of the city but also a toll road and then a subway system and this gave me a hell of a lot of money and so i spent it on health and education and i felt really good about myself for 5 or 10 minutes. i still don't have a girlfriend though" , 1 , 1429 , 0.949670374393463135 , 113 , 39 , 2013-07-05 05:55:15 , 631
"If modded this game even though its ten years old, in my opinion its much better than the new version. I bought this one again after finding out how bad the new one was. You should mod this game for sure though, with larger regions, the NAM and CAM and whatever else you want on the great modding sites for this game. 

Currently im playing on a very detailed  sat. map of the US with over 500 of the largest city tiles in one single region. Just one of my city tiles from what i heard is four times bigger than a city tile on the new version and i have over 500 of them, all are connected to and interact with each other. Building the entire country with things so spread out leaves tons of open land adding to the realism that the region system in this game creates.

"Everyone is right, it really is still the best city building game, even now in 2023 there's nothing better.  It still has a huge community over at https://community.simtropolis.com/  This game has more mods then you could ever have the time to try.  

It does need some tweaking to run well on modern pc's.  This is what was recommended to me to add to the game's Steam Launch Options command line which help optimize the game:

-intro:off -CustomResolution:enabled -r1920x1080x32 -CPUCount:1 -CPUPriority:high -Cursors:fullcolor

Just copy and paste the whole line into the Launch Options, where it says -r1920x1080x32 you can just change to your monitor's resolution size so you can play full screen.

Another helpful tweak is using the 4GB Patch tool here https://ntcore.com/?page_id=371 It allows old 32 bit games to use more memory to run.  Run the 4GB_Patch.exe file, it will open Windows Explorer.  Navigate to the game's install folder ...SimCity 4 Deluxe Edition\Apps and choose the file called SimCity 4.exe,  It will replace the file and make a backup of it.

Also make sure in the game's graphics options to set the Rendering Mode to Software, not Hardware.  Doing these steps allows the game to run smooth.  There's other tweaks you can learn as well that may help." , 1 , 137 , 0.923561513423919678 , 0 , 0 , 2023-11-19 05:40:12 , 139
"Looking for City Building Fun? Look no further!

Pros 
- Not Sim City 2013
- Looks very good for a game from 2004
- Gritty, Realistic, Approach to City Design 
- Large Selection of Terrains
- Easily Adjustable Settings
- Amazing Soundtrack
- Modding Kit makes for a longer game

Cons 
- Terrible System Optimization for Newer PCs
- Borderline Broken Demands on Easy and Medium Difficulties without Mods

I have been playing this game for years, picked it up on Steam last Summer. I have to say, the biggest issue I have with it now is Optimization on my PC. You cannot run the game past 1600x1080 without massive screen tearing and Region View Issues and Terrain Glitches (Purely Cosmetic.) Overall I would say the only other noticable issue, after 10 years (10 year old game better than a game made in 2013, who the fuck knew?!) is the broken system demands on Easy and Medium. Both difficulties will eventually go in complete negative demand, with no possible way to recover, unless you install mods, which leads to my next point. Even after all these years the modding community is still huge, so much effort goes into so many mods. Honestly I see no reason not to buy this game.

9/10 - Great game if you like City Planning and Building games." , 1 , 188 , 0.911231696605682373 , 1 , 10 , 2014-01-31 13:07:48 , 5274
"THE city simulator. It's old but it's the best one out there if you ask me. Even though the graphics aren't full 3D they are still surprisingly high definition and it is fun to zoom in close just to look at the buildings. The graphics really do still hold up. I was honestly surprised.

The gameplay is fantastic if you're into this genre although there are a few problems. Some of those can be fixed with mods, which there are plenty of. There's nothing that would ruin the experience, just some nit-picky things that would make a couple of things easier in the long run. The modding community is great and popular mods are totally worth getting even if some of them change the game mechanics quite a bit. If you new to the genre I would recommend you first play a city or two without mods to get the vanilla experience. For the fans of the genre: mod to your hearts content. You can pull a lot of extra depth out of the game with the right mods.

Depending on how you play once you reach that final stage with your city where everything runs like a finely oiled machine it might feel like you've reached the end. Some may continue to micromanage every little aspect for days to come but I recommend starting a new city. I personally prefer going for a visually impressive city rather than the most efficient one. Sim City becomes more of an information management/puzzle game if you aim for the most productive city. It is more enjoyable to create something visually pleasing.

You will waste days managing your city once you get sucked in. Prepare your calendar accordingly. This among my favorite games of all time.

(I have probably played SimCity a hundred hours back in the day. I still have the disc!)

"Thumbs up for the game itself that Maxis (not EA) created.

Thumbs down for the fact that EA drove Maxis into the dirt, and for the fact that they are selling a 20 year old game for $20 which doesn't even work on modern PC's without 3rd party .dll patches... which is basically tantamount to fraud (faulty product/false advertising).  Whatever, EA is trash.

Note: To any newbies attempting to play this, it's a good game but it was designed prior to multi-core CPU technology and will crash constantly unless you isolate the game to running on a single core.  Also, the game has not been updated to support any of the current GPU's/Widescreen resolutions.

The UI feels a little dated at this point, but the gameplay and even graphics have held up beautifully.

"First off I will say that my hour count is not correct, I played this for hundreds more hours on the disc version of the game. I caved in for the Steam version so I don't need my optical drive installed.

This game is my all time favorite game, nothing has come close to beating it. This game released more than 10 years ago still holds up very well thanks to the modders and the community of this game. If you don't like something about the game then search Simtropolis for a mod to fix it. 

As a beginner the modding might seem a bit scary. Tons of dependencies! What do I do?!? I started by installing the mods slowly. First the NAM mod which is essential, then other things such as added trees, buildings, etc. You don't need to install every mod at once to have fun in this game. Just be sure you install all the dependencies to the mods your installing, or else you'll get dreaded brown boxes all over your city (no fun!).

If you need to compare this to modern city builders such as Cities Skylines or Simcity 5 I still think that it beats it. Maybe it's just because I have a great nostalgia about this game. Cities Skylines is an excellent successor to this, but it just can't replace this game in my heart. Compared to Simcity 5, this game is amazing. Bigger cities, doesn't need Origin, and no major Agent problems. 

Whether you want to build an uber realistic city or just a casual city this game is definitely for you. It goes on sale for $5 during the sales, so if you can wait then I would recommend it. If you want a 3D city builder with easy to install mods Cities Skylines is probably for you. 

Also, before running this game check out the guides on Steam on how to run this on modern hardware. My system only needed some tweaks, but yours might need more. My system specs: AMD FX 6300, 8gb DDR3 RAM, AMD Radeon HD 7870, MSI 970a-g43 AM3+ motherboard.

"[b]I definitely recommend this game to every single person reading this. Such eternal classics as this is certainly a must-play for everyone, regardless of experience with PC gaming.[/b]

Briefly, SimCity 4 is, in my humble opinion, the best modern city building game even up to now. It can offer a lot both to casual players who want to spend their time on a relaxing city-building tycoon with nice visuals and music, and to hardcore players, that may find tons of deep and well hidden mechanics that - if used properly - can get your town sprawling into a huge metropolis in no time. 

And if you still somehow think that this is not enough - there are gazillion mods out there that add anything from new gameplay mechanics to new graphics and sounds. You can alter SimCity however you'd like and that's surely one of the game's major advantages over the majority of other city builders. 

Regarding Cities Skylines - of course it's a much newer and visually better game with tons of new simulation capabilities and new gameplay systems. However, SimCity makes up for it with smart and powerful region mechanics and lots of hidden detail that surely makes SC4, at least in my opinion, both more complex and more interesting than CS. 

If you're deciding what game is better to buy, I would, no doubt, say SimCity4 - but only because its much cheaper than Cities Skylines with all of it's money-grabbing DLCs. If you don't care about the price - buy both, neither of these two games should be ignored." , 1 , 68 , 0.868517398834228516 , 3 , 2 , 2022-03-15 09:13:20 , 7397
"I spent years playing this game for PC. The CD is still in my laptop right now. For those that don't know, SimCity is the originator of being a mayor, placing down your roads, zoning area for buildings, watching them grow and balancing the budget. This isn't for everyone, but to a lot of us, this is huge fun and SimCity 4 is probably the best in the series.

This is all single player, instead of the more current SimCity 2013 that is focused on multi-player. The game can cycle from night to day, but its just a look and doesn't seem to do anything special. You have terrain control like previous versions of SimCity before you start each game.

You start out in a region map of dozens of land plots. Large, medium and small. You pick a plot of land and make your city. You can then save that city, load the region and start up a new city on a different plot of land or go to a previous city. Why does this matter? Because you can trade between cities, you can export and import water, garbage, energy and so on. Not just that, but the sims / citizens can travel back and forth. Such as living in one town and going to another for work. You'll also have pollution effects that seep into other towns as well. This is all single player, so you need to jump between cities. Because two or more towns can thrive off of one another, you can put your heavy polluting industries in an extremely profitable town on their own with no residents living there to complain about how awful it is. There is no need for police, hospitals or schools if no one is living in your industrial city. Then just make some mass transit system for them to get to and from work.

When you play, you have full control from the start with only a few things locked away unlike Cities XL that requires your city to grow before it unlocks things for you. Because you have full control, that may set you up for failure quickly. Highways, big hospitals, deluxe police stations and so on cost big money and until your city is big, you should keep it small. Once your city grows, the game has ways to tell you that your hospital is too small, such as your staff workers will go on strike. How do you know if its too small? Sadly you can't just hold shift and click the building, you need to click the ? and then the building. It seems tedious, but you'll see what the building can handle and adjust its budget. If you can't adjust the budget high enough, its time to make a bigger version of the building or just plop down another building to do the same thing.

You need to keep your budget balanced, everything will cost monthly money, so you either need to cut spending from places like roads, schools, utilities or raise taxes, which might make some businesses, commerce and residents run to away from your city. When you lower taxes, of course people move in, but then your hospitals, schools and so on will be overcrowded, your buildings will grow larger. Its beautiful.

The game will tell you what kind of zones you'll need, such as low, medium and high density residential, commercial, industry and even agricultural. Its your job to plop them down. It has a graph to show you if you need more and less. If you need less, raise taxes for them, or replace the zone with a new zone. Luckily the game makes it easy to replace zones.

There are all sorts of charts and maps, such as pollution, both water and air. Crime, fire safety, land value and so on. If you want to raise land value, put down police, fire, schools and so on. Then add parks and various things to drive value up. Replace dirty industries that pollute with cleaner industries like medium density manufacturing.

You can also click on zoned buildings to see the crime, water, power, pollutants, and even the driving pattern of where the residents go and where the employees come from. Its a very nice feature. Especially if you're trying to reduce traffic. You have control over roads, avenues, streets, highways, trains, subways, busses and so on. Its fun to see just how far people will ride a bus to work. The game has plenty of charts too, in order to demonstrate how far the average drive is, how much garbage you have, the age and education of your population. Its all a lot of information.

On top of that, you have advisers that will tell you what's good and bad about your city. The game sadly uses pop up windows to tell you what's up, but thankfully there is a setting to turn it off, or else before you know it, you'll have nothing but popups. Instead you can look at the ticker at the bottom of the screen and even go into the advisers section to see their specific needs.

After all is said and done, you can then summon a natural disaster (or truckasaurus) to come and destroy your town. Why you'd want to? Just for the laughs I guess. 

Because this is the deluxe edition, it comes with Rush Hour expansion pack, which gives you the ability to take over vehicles and drive them on the road. Not first person, but still from the normal almost top down perspective. This content gives you missions that will give you cash and other rewards, but really, it doesn't feel like a great addition. Its just there.

This game is a classic, but after 10+ years, I don't think that its aged very well. After months of playing Tropico and Cities XL, those games just seem to run smoother control wise and have explanation to them. Having a hot key for pause would have been nice. Fires break out in your town extremely frequently, no matter how good your fire coverage is. It just breaks the flow of the game, you need to send your fire fighters out to stop the fire and wait while they put it out. That's just not fun.

There are also a few minor bugs, but some that will crash the game. Since there is no autosave, you can lose an hour's worth of progress if not an entire city.

It is still an enjoyable game and I can recommend it more than SimCity 2013. Is it worth the $10 - $20? No and yes. If you enjoy mayoring sims, you can sink days and months into this game, then its worth it, but you should wait for a $5 sale if not cheaper." , 1 , 99 , 0.850559651851654053 , 0 , 0 , 2014-06-24 21:41:41 , 2043

"SimCity BestCity

aight, Cities:Skylines is probs the best city designer game out there. With a yuuuge modding community and dedicated studio, CO have made a game where it's totally possible to build a realistic looking city.

you want to design the best looking city in a city building game, Cities:Skylines lets you put together a city with skyscrapers and extensive highway and mass transit networks carefully designed to the terrain's elevation and slope, with consideration to the aesthetic build of the land around you. You'll peel back and be very satisfied with your city of barely 40,000 people chugging your 8x quadcore beast. Then you'll load it up again and wait for 37 minutes as all of the assets take their time to load up. Then you play the best game of Traffic Management Simulator ever, take screenshots of road layouts that look like photos from a Real Estate brochure, it's amazing!

After 1600 hours of C:S gameplay I find there's something that SimCity 4 does better.

The simulation part of city building.

SimCity 4 takes moments to load up a city of nearly a million inhabitants. You deal in a more abstracted simulation, which helps to immerse you in managing the expansion of your city, improving services, and designing interesting layouts within the limitations offered by the grid layout. And even those limitations can be worked around if you bother getting mods.

SC4's biggest weakness is the lack of modding support from EA, but here they shine in an unusual way, and that's the community support. EA is garbage, but the SC community is great. It's much smaller but very dedicated. You find mods and an active community of people with a great attitude.

The CS community is weaker in this sense. There are a heap of modders and asset creators in CS who make amazing things, and I use them, but you also find many more gatekeepers in the Paradox/CS forums who tell you your ideas are garbage, and admins who are triggerhappy and also tell you that your ideas are garbage.

In one way, the limitations of a game designed over 10 years ago do hold SimCity 4 back, and it's a testament to how great this game is as a city building simulator that it's still so replayable and fun.

Imagine if we could get the old Maxis team back, get them to forget the last two iterations of the SimCity franchise (that weird SimCity Societies, which was bad, and SimCity 2013, which was also bad), give them 2020 game making tools, and just imagine how cool SimCIty could become." , 1 , 80 , 0.838170289993286133 , 3 , 0 , 2020-11-15 02:14:01 , 3688

"Since I won't touch SimCity 2013 (and Origin in general) due to all the problems and irritants those bring to the table, SimCity 4 is the most recent choice of SimCity games that I can really play. It is dated and has some issues such as lack of widescreen support and the other usual issues older games have with newer OS's, but that can be fixed. And despite that, from what I have heard, this game is [i]still[/i] better than the recent remake even without all those online issues that game had, with more features and larger maps to build cities on. Also this game has a strong modding community (Simtropolis) with an insane amount of new buildings and stuff to add to your game. Ideally you want a good PC if you plan on making super-big cities and don't want your game to lag like crazy, but even my poo PC can more or less handle this fine despite having built cities more densely populated than any currently existing on Earth.

So if you feel the sudden urge to build cities, and yet realize that so many city building games of the past few years have a host of glaring issues, then SimCity 4 is your best choice. Have fun! :D" , 1 , 109 , 0.832211554050445557 , 3 , 10 , 2014-11-23 23:19:41 , 12236

"People honestly trying to review a 16 year old game is just sad, tbh. And like it or not, SC4 is still the most nuanced entry in the genre, and is the most extensively mod-friendly; still maintaining an active modding community on Simtropolis and SC4 Devotion *to this day*.

There are even people who have been working on the same region for over a decade. When you look at modern games, and how depreciated the value and content is, potentially having a decade's worth of enjoyment from a game simply isn't possible in this day and age. You'd be lucky to get *months* out of modern live service products, before getting bored.

Whining about how dated the game is falls flat to me, because there are countless mods that help bring the game up to date. The communities are still active, friendly and welcoming to newcomers, and the game isn't that hard to customize. Sure, there are some hard-coded problems like no multi-core support, but they're not crippling problems as often claimed.

Some people have devoted many years of their lives to keeping this game thriving. And in my eyes, Sim City 4 isn't a mere game. It's more like a hobby or passion. And the industry (especially EA) just doesn't make games like this anymore. That's what you're getting from this game; a look into a bygone era; the golden age of simulation games on PC.

Q: Oh? Then why do you only have 96 hours played, if it means so much to you? I am very intelligent. Check and mate, millennial!

"Ever thought you could make a better city? Pah, I could be a better Mayor; well now you can! SimCity 4 is just that and offers this opportunity and lets you sit in the chair titled mayor. I've definitely clocked up more hours in the days I installed this on ME and XP. 

SimCity 4 Deluxe Edition is another one of those games that has been created by EA... EA? Not again you say - except this time.. EA has really created a game and has polished it up to its standards. SC4 is one of the older prequels to 'Societies' and the 2013 SimCity relaunch; released after Sim City 3000, it showed off superb graphic capabilities at the time and invented new ways to enjoy building a simulated city, where you play as the city's major, managing the: finances, housing stock, roads, ports, resident satisfaction, transit, and employment.

You start off with the tutorial scenario which are all in-game. It forces you try things out as you go along, completing objectives which teaches you how to build, manage power/water supplies, landscaping, and the rest. After you complete that (or can't be bothered to and skip it), you can either build in that same region or start building cities in one of the few preset regions that have already been created.

Running your 'regions' as a Mayor is all about understanding what generates tax and increases monthly cost. In between all that, there are no objectives, and as your revenue rises, so does your population, which means a bigger list of demands which requires more expenditure. Building cleaner buildings (i.e. renewable energy) or schools can benefit the city's future pathway, but will have a serious hit on your monthly expense, expect to raise your taxes, lose reputation, and lower management costs should you fall in debt. If you do fall in debt, the game does offer a few short-term resolutions. You start to unlock buildings that generate a small amount of income which normally take a few hours to do so normally; you will also be able to take out a loan from the bank, or you can carry on raising taxes or just destroy your schools and hospitals (unwise!!). 

When starting a city you will decide on a Mayor's name and city name. There are three difficulty settings to pick from which affects the costs, starting money and the levels of income. You first steps is to create power, then allocate three different zones, these are: Residential Zones, Commercial Zones, and Industrial Zones. You then sit back and watch development take place as cement trucks, family cars, and trucks move in to take up the zones. You cannot choose exactly what buildings you want to be build there, as it is dependant on a 'building style' option, and factors including its surroundings, population of the city, education and health levels etc. You can, however, limit the construction style to Low Density, Medium Density, or High Density. Low Density forces the houses being built to house small families or mansions; whilst High Density houses towering skyscrapers which can be an overwhelming sight to look at. The Commercial zones offers offices, retail stores, and local diners; and lastly the Industrial Zone creates factories, from dirty industry, manufacturers, to high-tech research buildings. A good combination of all 3 makes a good city; which makes good profit, which gives you lots of money to re-invest into your (unlucky) citizens.

After creating your zones you also need to think about your increasing demands for water, power, and waste collection. A city will not work efficiently without power and water. You will need to think about the education of your citizens, placing schools, colleges and libraries help enhance their knowledge which in-turn, create better jobs, provide places for wealthier people, which all contribute to making a great city.

Safety is also another priority in the game. You also have to build Police Stations, Fire Departments, Hospitals in key locations where they will help make your city a safer place which attracts wealthier citizens moving into your city, and again, creates a better city.

Lastly, another factor you have to remember when creating your city is Environment. You will, in some point later on in the game, have to build parks, flower gardens, fields of greens and eventually reduce the level of water and air pollution your city, from the early game where you had factories and unskilled workers. This is because you need good land to attract wealthier Sims who have educated to run more profitable office and tech businesses. In addition to building green space, you will also have to plant trees, or (one of my favourites) raise taxes on Dirty Industry to keep them away from producing in your city. Trading is also a valuable way to generate income, by connecting roads and rail with neighbouring cities. It's an automated process so you don't need to worry about it later on. 

The expansion pack Sim City 4 Rush Hour adds a whole new dimension of gameplay to it, introducing a new method of gaining income and unlocking structures more easily. You can compete in missions which lets you drive literally cars, planes, boats in a top-side view similar to to an RTS setting, except only by using the arrow keys or WASD Keys. 

Overall, Sim City was a huge leap in City designing simulations and is probably used as a template for recent games. It doesn't need as much micromanaging as SimCity Societies nor SimCity, but is still an entertainign classic to own. Regardless of your experience with City Life, Cities In Motion, Tropico, CivCity, SimCity Societies (or even SimCity), SimCity 4 is still a fun and enjoying experience, and should be classed as a landmark in its genre.

"Game crashing on startup?

add this with what your desktop res is set at in the Steam options (in properties) and it will (hopefully) work:  (replace the 1920 and 1080 with your own desktop res)

-CustomResolution:enabled -r1920x1080x32

Anyways that's the fix that worked for me, maybe it will work for others.

As for the game itself?

The soundtracks are phenomenal and the gameplay is creative and engaging. There are (optional) vehicle missions that can add a little fun where you can drive/fly around your cities and interact for cash, approval rating boosts, and special buildings. And for us modders there is an expansive array of mods available.

I really enjoyed this game in the 90's/2000s and i still really enjoy it today. If you like city builders this is a gem of a title.

"Even after 21 years, and three major modern attempts at creating a new pure city-building game, nothing comes close to touching SC 4. And I'm not saying that just simply out of nostalgia. The only bad quality to SC 4, is its infamous instability issues, which can be controlled if you learn what causes CTDs and how to prevent them. 

The biggest reasons why SC 2013, CS1, and CS2 doesnt touch this game:

1) Realistic city sizes. SC 2013 city squares are childishly way too tiny. Not even a modern American village IRL could realistically fit on them. Nevermind, a city of over 10,000. 

Meanwhile, CS1 and CS2 becomes so bogged down with the AI trying to control tens of thousands of different agents, that most people's hardware cannot get much above 100,000 in population.

2) Graphics. The graphics of SC 4 is realistically gritty. It inst this weird cartoon-ey plastic look that Colossus Order STILL insisted on making for CS2! Especially the vehicles! Like. Come ON! This is now the 2020s. The idiotic and weirdly childish cartoon graphics trend of the 2010s should FINALLY be over! I'm a grown adult who wants to build a REALISTIC city! NOT in the environment of Paw Patrol!

SC 4 graphics have a more realistic gritty feeling to them compared to the 3 year old child-level Paw Patrol 3D graphics of SC 2013, CS1 and CS2.

"Simply the best city simulator out there and a serious challenge to boot. Not without its flaws of course, but with 18+ years of community mods and addons that are still expanding, it just never gets old.

Ignore the naysayers, the game when setup right is totally rock-solid, Steam don't help though, since all modern machines need you to add the command -CPUCount:1 under Set Launch Options. This is because the game crashes if you have a multi-core system, which as I write this in 2021, let's face we pretty much all do. Why this isn't there by default is beyond me.

Just add the NAM (Network Addon Mod) to transform the number of Transport networks and options. Although I'd highly recommend looking into other mods too, but the NAM is really a must.

The real beauty of SC4 however comes from being a 2.5D or Isometric view, rather than the fully 3D games of today. This means the game uses pre-rendered assets, rather than having to render every model (3D) on the fly. In practical terms, it means the models can be highly detailed with no polygon limits whatsoever, because the game only has to 'wallpaper' a 2D texture onto a simple 3D box. That makes for some astounding visuals, without melting your PC, in fact this game doesn't need a particularly powerful PC to play its best. However, being an older game your hardware needs good support for DirectX 7 legacy modes, something newer GPUs are starting to eschew. Even that can be bypassed these days by using something called a Wrapper.

But really what makes it the ultimate game of its genre, is the hidden complexity of the simulator. There is so much going on and you as mayor need to keep everything under control to succeed. Unlike the modern 3D equivalents like SimCity (2013) and Cities Skylines, you can't just play the game on auto-pilot. I get the feeling because the simulators of the newer titles don't properly work and to compensate, you can get away with letting things go bad for a long time before it actually harms your progress. Whereas SC4 demands your attention at all times, especially during the later stages of development. If you prefer a detailed simulation, there really is no comparison between them. Start slow, take things step by step and realise this is a reactive experience and you should remain in control of things. There is a bit of a steep learning curve, but the game is also very rewarding for those who stick with it. I certainly wouldn't recommend it for the more casual player, Cities Skylines is likely to be more enjoyable in that case. Maxis pushed the limits of what was possible in the early 21st century and their creation has stood the test of time because they just don't make games like this anymore." , 1 , 34 , 0.778217494487762451 , 1 , 0 , 2021-07-07 15:06:47 , 3717

"SimCity 4 was my first city builder game. That statement is not nostalgic - I first played SimCity 4 this year rather than 20 years ago, and I am very happy to say that this game is awesome! There is a lot to like.

First of all, I've had no technical problems or annoyances. I play the game through Steam with no mods, no EA account and no crashes! The controls are largely intuitive to me, even though the game is 20 years old and I've never played a city builder before.

The music is fantastic. In my opinion it strikes just the right balance of being lively and engaging whilst remaining backgrounded enough to not distract you from the gameplay or get irritating even when you play for hours at a time (and it's difficult not to!).

The artstyle is cute and fun. It's obviously not modern but that doesn't stop it from being a treat for the eyes!

The challenging gameplay is both good and bad. It's great to have to think about how to manage your city's growth and how to add new facilities without going bankrupt. I enjoy the difficulty when I understand it or when there is enough information to figure it out. However, some things are left unexplained which makes the gameplay feel frustrating at times. I've played for over 100 hours and still feel at a loss as to how to deal with certain problems that arise. When I've paid attention to the various graphs and data views and still can't understand the source of a problem, I had hoped the team of city advisors would offer guidance or at least nudge me in the right direction, especially considering that I've been playing on easy difficulty. I even read the digital manual that comes with the game and couldn't see any tips in there either. I'm not so keen on challenges that are hard because information is unavailable. Still, I keep learning as I play, so it may be that experience is the best teacher for SimCity 4.

I think the thing that has me so invested in SimCity 4 is the attention to detail that creates a sense of activity and of life occupying the cities. There are Sims spraying graffiti on the walls of commercial properties, farmers on ladders picking apples in the fields, zombies roaming the graveyards. When you look closely, you can see that even duplicates of the same item, such as the bus stops, actually differ. For example, one bus stop may have a hedge, a phone booth and newspaper vending machines, while another may have a fence, a post box and a drinks machine. I really appreciate these little touches; it's adorable <3 The sound effects that correspond to each building, such as the 'shh' when you click on the library, are also great fun. The sense of life is supported by the continuous change and development seen in the buildings. A building can be reconstructed to house more Sims as demand increases in your city, and the architecture changes over the years (if you choose) which gives the city a feeling of history. Similarly, problems in the cities are shown through buildings falling into disrepair or rubbish piling up on the streets. The game does an amazing job of demonstrating your influence.

SimCity 4 is challenging, vibrant, satisfying and so much fun.

"Cities: Skylines is brilliant. But I like this.

Don't let my low number of hours fool you. I've had the game on CD since around 2008, and invested hundreds of hours into it. Buying it digitally after not playing it for a decade, it has undoubtedly stood the test of time and remains one of the best city builders out there - there is a lot to it, yet it is so easy to learn.

Just to note before you buy: The game most likely won't work out of the box on modern OS's, but there are mods and a dedicated launcher (SC4Launcher) that will improve performance and allow running on 1080p+ monitors" , 1 , 39 , 0.760724186897277832 , 0 , 0 , 2023-07-01 21:07:06 , 96

"TL;DR: Took a military jet to the nuclear plant and recreated chernobyl. Built safe zone city one region slot over. Raised volcano in safe zone city and burned all survivors. 
10/10 would hijack expensive military equipment again

Actual review (yes, cities skylines taken into comparison):

This is the supreme reigning king of city builders. While in time it will likely be beaten by Cities: Skylines, as of now this is still the best in terms of purely easy to use UI, fun things to do (the TL;DR is easily possible ingame), sheer number of mods, and customizability. I have thousands of hours in on the simcity series as a whole and only bought this on steam as another version (I still use disc/GoG versions more). The majority of the hours went into either 3000/unlimited or this version, both pre-and post-rush hour expansion (included in this one).

Keep in mind this is also the HARDEST of the simcity games, and even on easy it is very possible to screw yourself over several hours in with a chronicly failing city that slowly decays into destruction on its' own. It's also one of the most fun, however, as SimCity 3000 did away with the terraforming (mostly) of simcity 2000, and this was the first (of 2) in the series to introduce regional gameplay with multiple cities interacting on a massive map. Big difference between this and the latest simcity, however, is that in addition to preset regions, YOU create them. You can terraform them, modify their size, city layouts/sizes literally using microsoft paint, plop the cities, set up the city interactions, etc. The only thing missing is the multiplayer, but with the city sizes in this being arguably 16 times larger than simcity 2013, that more than makes up for it as you will sink dozens of hours into filling up a map and customizing it the way you want to with what is also the best UI in the series, doing a lot of the work for you and letting you optimize where and when needed.

So, why would I even recommend this over Cities: Skylines?

AS OF RIGHT NOW. As of the time of this review, Cities: Skylines is a fantastic city builder with a mass modding community and...that's it. There is no regional play, terraforming has to be modded in to be performed mid-game, the art style is VERY bland and probably has less than 100 buildings the game can call upon to place down in zones, the UI when placing roads and such has a lot of issues that make it much harder to use than it should be, there's a lot of missing features that have to be modded in, and the ability to truly customize the city is significantly lower than in this game. While I will continue to play cities skylines, I have the game heavily - and I mean HEAVILY - modded to even begin to replicate the magic of SimCity 4 and its' predecessors. I feel like the game was designed around being better than SimCity 2013 which in some aspects (art, soundtrack, pure...fun things to do, customizability) it isn't, but the major missing things in SimCity 2013 (city sizes, DRM, lack of map editing) were what drew people in. That, and the game expected it so it would have a large modding scene to fix what the developers didn't add. That's understandable, as the dev team is VERY small for Cities Skylines, but the thing is that SimCity 2013 lowered the bar of city builders to a point where Cities: Skylines was no longer just below it, but far above it.

Understand this: I WILL continue to play cities skylines. And I believe it is a great game. But it is going to take a monster that can do what Cities Skylines did to fix the SimCity 2013 formula, and also take the time to add in what SimCity does RIGHT, before there will be a city builder capable of dethroning this one. It has to look and play the part, and give the user the ability to have FUN above all with customizability, destruction, and other random things that occur (like piloting a military chopper guns blazing into your own house...like you can in this game).

If you do NOT own this game and are a fan of city builders, I highly encourage you to get it now. At a price of $20 for the base AND its expansion, the only downside is compatibility with modern OS systems, and it is still possible to make it work with a bit of stuff done. What you're ultimately getting is the definitive city builder, and what remains the king of city builders that many of us fondly remember from our childhoods and will continue to remember.

"The simulation genre wouldn't be what it is without the venerable SimCity series. Since 1989, the many entries in the line have allowed people to become virtual mayors and design cities of just about any shape and size, limited only by the contents of the game itself. They've come a long way from the original and branched out in many different ways across platforms, and not every installment has been a success. SimCity 4 is often described as the last great SimCity, and with that and my own remembered fondness for it I decided to see how it's held up over the last 13 years.

Honestly I find it a little difficult to describe the nature of SimCity, because it is such an elemental part of the genre. You lay down roads, outline zones for development of homes and businesses, build power plants and fire stations, balance your taxes against your utility expenditures, and grow your little town as large as it will go. These are all core concepts pioneered by the series, but 4 presents them with greater refinement. Each individual service building like police stations and hospitals can have their funding adjusted to meet local demand, so you can build expensive services and then scale them back to what you can afford until you need more. Zone density can also be scaled up or down without destroying existing buildings, allowing them to grow or shrink as needed.

It's one of the purest and accessible presentations of the city-building formula out there, with no production chains or unlockables to concern yourself with. You build what you want, where you want, with the only limitations being space and money. SimCity 4 is far more generous than its predecessors with the latter, allowing you to start with enough money to cover most of a map right from the outset. And with control of individual building funding, it's a simple task to keep your budget in the green. The maps remain plenty large enough for bustling metropolises, but they're also connected by regions, allowing you to get a grand overview of your cities, granting your people the option of commuting to other areas, and creating massive metro areas with interconnected cities and neighborhoods.

The end result is a robust and expansive city-builder limited only by its age. SimCity 4 is still a 2D game, despite some voxel trickery to make it look deeper and more dynamic than it is. You're laying everything out on a grid, which makes building at anything other than right angles either cumbersome in the case of roads and rails, or impossible in the case of buildings. The terrain is deformable and conforms to your constructions to a point, but if your landscape is very hilly at all you'll end up with houses built on soaring foundations larger than the dwelling itself, and beaches and piers plunging off of your coastlines into the deep. The detailed pixel art of the buildings is impressive, and each is rendered from four directions so you can rotate the camera, but they look chunky at max zoom and indistinct at a distance.

Despite these shortcomings, SimCity 4 remains one of the finest city-builders you can lose yourself in. The steady pace of construction matched with the enormous variety of buildings and services to work towards means you can spend hours crafting a single city without having to wait for long periods or growing bored. The data displays show you everything you need to understand how your city operates, from pollution and traffic overlays to the actual routes your citizens take daily. There are even optional driving missions you can take in your own city and Sims you can move in to get more personal feedback. It might not be the prettiest or slickest offering anymore, but SimCity 4 has stood the test of time and remains one of the most addictive and comprehensive city-builders on the market.

"I played hundreds of hours of this game as a child.  When taking of the rose-colored glasses in 2020 I don't really think it holds up against the likes of Cities: Skylines, but it's still enjoyable to visit now and again.

Pros:
*  Lots of interesting structures to unlock.  After 16 years I still feel live I've not seen everything this game has to offer.
*  Absolutely fantastic music.  Very few games come close to the quality seen here.
*  Region scale, and the interplay between cities, can yield some very interesting results.
*  Per-structure funding is a lot better than what's in C:S
*  The Maxis personality (mostly their quirky sense of humor) is infectious to this day.

Cons:
*  To get it running on modern resolutions without graphical glitches you've got to play around with launch options
*  Runs poorly due to the single-threaded back end.  This doesn't really matter too much since you're usually playing from a locked camera perspective, though.
*  The grid layout vs C:S' open-form means of construction feels really limiting.
*  Some UX, like that used in placing elevated rail, can be really cumbersome to work with.
*  Mass transit can be a mess.  Route management in C:S has spoiled me, so coming back to this and placing a subway station just to see it overwhelmed with little I can do to fix it (aside from building a 2nd) is annoying.
*  Buildings seem to drop in wealth levels for no apparent reason (building information shows everything's fine)
*  Cars disappearing on the road all the time makes the city a lot less interesting to look at than what I remember.

Cons aside, this is a must-play if you're in to city builders / management games.  Every modern game in the genre has looked to this for inspiration, and even though I don't think it's the king any more it's still a legend." , 1 , 26 , 0.745046555995941162 , 2 , 0 , 2020-08-16 18:15:21 , 886
"Not bad, I could say about a 8/10. The graphics look old, but I don't care. It's a classic, much better than SimCity 2013. If you had a choice to buy either this, or SimCity 2013, get this one.

Worth the money, and much much bigger cities than the new one. You also get taller skyscrapers, easily design your zones, like downtown. There's also mods for this game, but I recommend playing it without mods.

Please try this game, it's great. Who cares if it was made in 2004? (Idk if that was the date) 

OH AND it comes with Rush Hour. You can control helicopters, cars, and such. $20 for game + addon = Worth it. :)

"This game is the bomb diggity, even after 13+ years.
PROS:
++Great, mostly balanced gameplay
++Good looking 2.5D graphics
++Endless amount of mods and assets
++Has full 1080p support, in a *13 year old game!*
++Runs pretty well on nearly anything
CONS:
--Hard to get working properly (I suggest looking for the SC4Launcher and 4GB patch if you want to really boost how the game works)
--Can crash a lot without the right settings
--Mods are difficult to install w/o Steam Workshop support
--The simulation is often finicky, but granted, there was only so much devs could do back then (pickup the Network Addon Mod for improved traffic simulation)
--The tutorial isn't super-helpful in helping you understand how the regional simulation works

Overall, if you're looking at this vs Cities: Skylines (and have a PC that can run C:S), go pick up Cities. It's a newer game with generally a more powerful and realistic simulation. However, I highly suggest dropping this into your wishlist and waiting for a sale, which is quite often on this title, because this game has a certain charm that I don't think any city builder has or ever will replicate." , 1 , 29 , 0.742165327072143555 , 0 , 1 , 2016-12-28 09:06:23 , 24745

The nicer little details are more the things that happen in the world you build in. Like animals in the forests/oceans that make it hard to justify building over their habitats. Driving missions to earn money while your city develops. The point is it just feels nice to watch and play with things as they progress.

"This game is hands down the best city simulator, but it requires the Network Add-on Mod (NAM) and a few other plug-ins that can be downloaded from places like Simtropolis.com or SC4fanatic.com to be a great sim game. The mods add things like rural highways, bridges, and better route finding and capacities on the road network. As a civil engineer, I love this game to this day even though I have been playing it for over a decade. I work on my region daily and find the simulation with the addons is pretty close to real world dynamics as far as transportation, sanitation, and water works. Huge regions can run on todays computers with downloadable real maps and terrain available- you can build in real locations, build Seattle with a world class waterfront or maybe download the Alsek Bay area of Alaska and build a series of mountain towns between the towering mountains and long beaches along a river with alpine lakes.

"Having lived through the Maxis downfall of the late 90s and eventual handover to EA, and having played every Sim City but the newest one, having loved different things about all of them and having realised I'd spent more time on Sim City 4 Deluxe than any other, I felt I owed it to this game to give it my retroactive review.

Like most of us city-builder fans I tried out and fell in love with Cities Skylines shortly after it came to the limelight and like all new and improved game interfaces and technology, my expectations for a City Builder have increased along side them. So it's hard for me to appreciate the Sim Cities now as much as I did then but SC4D, despite having many annoyances with UI and a lack of some modern freedoms does still offer an unprecedented amount of control in the Sim City range.
Small things like different zoning densities and diagonal roads don't seem like a big deal, but because Maxis was basically the only big company doing these titles, it was a game-changer for the time and playing around with those limited complexities is still incredibly satisfying in 2017.
The other thing SC4 does better than many other games is the introduction and tutorial of the concepts and screens. Everything is intuitive, even to non city builders and I remember always loving Maxis' ability to produce fluid gameplay from start to finish, it's held up just as well today.

Ultimately most of the things I don't like about this game are because more modern titles have done them better, added more freedoms and removed small annoyances, but to criticise a game by comparing it to something that didn't exist at the time is a fools errand. Yes, I would recommend other titles above this now if you're new to the genre or have limited cash, but I would also very much recommend trying out some of the older Sim City titles because they're still engrossing and satisfying and stand up well today." , 1 , 24 , 0.733812928199768066 , 0 , 0 , 2017-09-14 06:48:11 , 646

"SimCity 4 > SimCity 5

The game is quite fun even though it is old. It IS IMPORTANT to note that you need to put a code (look it up online if you want) into the start up of the game on steam, since the game does not use your computers multi processors. This prevents your game from crashing *cry*. 

Pros:
-region view to see your cities. The game comes with London, San Francisco, Berlin, New York and two fantasy ones. 
- Development demand is based on your region, allowing specialization. 
- Lots of types of buildings that look old and new. 
- Famous American Landmarks and some international
- The game is challenging, even on easy.

"I've spent probably thousands of hours on this game before I even had a Steam account (big Sims fan in general). It wasn't until I got it a few months ago that I actually even had a clue on how to even properly play the game. But moving along from memory lane, this game is still amazing for being as old as it is.

Having been released in 2003 and made available on Steam in 2010, this game and even the game series itself can honestly be seen as revolutionary for the city-building and simulation games that have followed since the original simcity was released. This game was almost in a way ahead of its time and in my opinion STILL outshines many other city-building games (maybe I haven't played enough but who knows) that try to recreate in their own sense the management strategy that SimCity brought upon the world of gaming. The replay value of this game is beyond compare, for something different is always awaiting you, and the mods are endless to build off what the game originally provided.

The beauty about this particular game is that it can be both a place anything anywhere and watch what happens sort of game but it also can be a complex square by square city builder where you perfect every detail and the style of your houses to the taxes each individual industry and residential type pays. Many modern city builders try to play off this but say unlike City Skylines where you have to work your way up to get more land to begin with, there are countless areas and regions of all sizes for you to use and connect and even create to eventually have the ultimate city or state or nation or whatever you wish. Plus the music is pretty damn great as well. The game just allows you to almost settle down and lose yourself. SimCity 4 has to honestly be my FAVORITE city-builder out there, as it still is for many. But that's just a personal opinion. For it's current price of $19.99 and replay value that is seemingly endless, i'd say it's worth it.

"Ah, SimCity 4, the best, in my opinion, of all of the SimCity games. The graphics are dated, being that this was released around fifteen years ago, but don't let that deter you. Play times depend on how much you enjoy city building games. I myself have spent 2-4 hours today playing it.

 The U-Drive-It mode is pretty cool, as it lets you drive through your transportation system with a variety of vehicles, but can get annoying over time with the other cars.

 The regions are a nice addition, as you can have cities depend on each other, plus some of the regions come in the shape of several real-life cities, albeit with no structures. In the same vein, importing and exporting cities & regions are useful. If you have a sprawling metropolis and want to share it with the world, you can! Have a police state with stations on every corner? You now can show it to your friends and family!

 On the game crashes, there are, apparently, mods to fix this, but a simple fix without the use of mods exists. Simply navigate to your Steam Library, right-click SimCity 4 (assuming you own it), click properties, and under the General Tab click Launch Options. In the box, paste -CPUCount:1 (without quotes.) I have done this myself, and haven't had a single crash since doing so. My OS is Windows 10 Home.

There is also a 3rd party launcher, made specially for SC4, with a nice 'n simple UI, and several QoL improvements, such as autosaving, and the ability to completely skip the opening videos entirely. Here's the official page; https://www.vitim.us/project/sim-city4-launcher/ Click on the Download now phrase at the bottom to, you've guessed it, download. I recommend this option.

The SimCity 4 playerbase is a very devoted one, with a website based around it, among a few other city builders. https://community.simtropolis.com They feature modifications for the game, plus a gallery, and forum. And city journals? Looks to be detailed diaries on people's cities. Huh. Anyway! Here's a good mod, if you'd like some diversity and/or complexity for your transit systems, try NAM, or the Network Addon Mod. https://community.simtropolis.com/files/file/26793-network-addon-mod-nam-cross-platform/
Got its own darn installer, its so complex.

 In conclusion, I believe SimCity 4 to be a great game, and holds up after 15 years. It has some good mods made for it, as well. My personal rating is 8/10.

It might scare people used to less demanding games since the latter simcity versions don't have such a deep management system, but once you get acquainted with that, it gets really funny and you can concentrate on creating wonderful cities, even by using plugins and mods.

"This is the definitive version of any SimCity. Much better than the sequel SimCity: Societies.

TL;DR: Even though it is 13 years old it is still one of the best examples of a city builder today. I'd rate it [b] 8/10 [/b]

This game was one of the major contributors to Cities:Skylines as it is Paradox's main inspiration for the game. The [i]U-Drive it[/i] Missions are unique to city builders wherein you can interact with your city on a much more indepth level. The economics aren't simplified and the advisors offer advise that can actually be used. For being a very fixed camera in an isometric setup, you get plenty of gorgeous angles and shots. The modding community for this game is still alive as far as I recall, although a lot of it is becoming harder to find certain things such as Network Addon Mod (NAM).  

The main drawbacks of the game are mainly due to its age. Unlike Cities it isn't based on both a free building and grid based snapping system. This is solely grid based and it has a very big drawback, bridges. You can only build bridges certain directions and in straight lines. The other main drawback is performance issues on certain new machines and crashes. But I believe you can find a patch around for a fix for the crashes. A minor more nit-picky issue with the Steam version is that unlike a box you don't get a pamphlet that gives good advice about RCI and how to increase and meet demand, but again you can probably find a picture of the RCI pamphlet on the internet.

Overall the game is excellent. Even though my hours on the Steam edition are lackluster, playing on the two-disk box version is where most of my hours really come from. As said above, [b] 8/10 [/b]" , 1 , 19 , 0.70498579740524292 , 1 , 0 , 2016-08-28 20:16:56 , 250

"I'm like a lot of people here - the hours we've played don't reflect the many more we've done on CD. In my mind there are only really two city building games: Cities Skylines and Sims City 4. Others have tried, and they all appear to have failed, including Sim City and EA who include this in the game pass but have buried Sim Cities Societies and Sim City (reboot) somewhere in a corn field. 

Part of the reason this game wins over a game like Cities Skylines and manages to keep relevant is because it's avoided getting into the minute modelling process that many other games have done. Rather than having real individual people that live their entire lives, SC4 keeps things a bit abstract. As it turns out, it makes it easier to manage as a city, avoiding a lot of the pitfalls from current generation games including C:S (like for example the traffic that never really works), whilst also removing the dry heaving even the most modern computer endure from playing modern games.

You are brilliant, you are loved. If someone could make a new version of this with updated graphics that'd be swell, but at the same time you still bring so much joy.

I feel a lot more ownership  of the cities I cultivate in this game than I do in Cities XL or Skylines.  I'm not sure why this is exactly.  I imagine it's the engine under the hood and the way it responds to the city design.  It's probably a lot more simplistic than a modern city builder but for some reason I feel more connected to it.

"Heavily recommended, 

Sim city 4 is still competing nowadays  to be the 1st city builder (and in my opinion it is). You are here to build a city and cover all it needs, from garbage management, energy distribution, crime reduction, tourism... 

Basically Sim city 4 is a big map divided in squares. On each square you can build a city, and all those cities are working with each other. In other terms, build Factory city with its large industries to provide some jobs for the citizens of the neighboring city of SunnyTown. It's pretty funny to handle and requires good attention to keep your world balanced!

Graphically, the game is charming and the music is good. You can spend hours in it and it's rather addictive!

It's also possible to mod the game to improve the road system and add various buildings." , 1 , 39 , 0.683273434638977051 , 3 , 1 , 2014-10-27 19:13:39 , 4534
"SimCity 4 is a fun simulation game as it give you a general sense of economics about taxes, supply, and demand. Here's some advice to note about playing this game: You want to run your city without over spending on irrelevant things you don't need, you don't want to over tax your citizens too much, because you'll lose your population, and if you tax the hell out businesses, you'll have no demand for businesses to establish in your city. Once you master supply and demand, and regulate taxes accordingly, you'll suceed to achieve what it takes to insure an auspicious society, and the posterity to come. The only flaws I have with this game, is it tends to crash evey half-hour or so, and there's no AutoSave to save all of your progress.

"Playtime (with mods such as Network Addon Mod, and Colossal Addon Mod (NAM and CAM), is absolutely limiteless.  As a testament, I am still playing this game 10-11 years after it's release.  I don't feel compelled to move to the always-gotta-be-online new simcity.  I don't need snazzy 3d for a casual game when I get all the feedback and playability this way.  There are so many different ways to set things up.  Totally flat worlds, or mountainous terrain, or even a city by the bay.  HUGE cities in this game, with proper modding as described above can support over FOUR MILLION people on a single CITY.  It's very reasonable to expect to have 50-100 million people in a large region if you devote time into this. 
With the NAM mod mentioned above, you can build absolutely breathtaking realistic freeways just like you use on your commute to work or commuting to a shopping spree (heh).  With CAM mod, you can build huge skyscrapers and zone denser than ever before and really have a reason for all those highways.
Build Seawalls, Docks, Highways and Raised Road Viaduct/byways, Mass transportation suched as raised rail/monorail/subways/ground light rail and connecting all these together (mods may be required for some of these, but they are very worth it).  Build photo-realistic cities that you yourself wouldn't mind lodging up in.  
The mods alone make this game easily worth it's 20 bucks (US $) without a doubt, and if it's on sale, you'd have to be a fool not to pick it up.  Simcity 2013 is like a graphically enhanced sample, of what this game is.  If you enjoy Simcity 2013 but would like to grow bigger, higher, more populous cities, and have complete control of the road network of your dreams, this game is for you!  
You can spend hours just trying to mod this, there are thousands and thousands of different ones to choose from.  Start with NAM and CAM as stated and start looking around for what peaks your interest - with one caveat:  Watch those dependancies!

"Despite being fourteen years old at the time of this review, this game is still entertaining. I think a huge part of it is how well it ages - it came out in 2003, but there are no musical or UI or humor clues that would tie it to the early 2000s. It's still one of the best city simulators out there, and if you're willing to add these to your launch options (or Google platform specifics): 
[code] -CPUCount:1 -CustomResolution:enabled -r1920x1080x32 -intro:off -w -d:software -CPUPriority:high [/code]
you won't experience any issues with the game crashing, plus you get to play it in HD. The modding community is still alive and well, somehow. 

But most of all, SC4 just looks [i]good[/i]. The art style is cohesive, the colors and day-night cycles are on point (mostly), and despite almost everything being 2D pixel graphics it looks beautiful, especially if you know how to arrange your city. 

My one issue is that the game, like any single-player simulation, feels a little lonely sometimes. And if you get creative with Dropbox you can play a sort-of multiplayer, but there's no true MP built into the game. It's a good thing for the most part, because there's none of the always-online bullshit that comes with a lot of single-player games these days.

Basically, if you like any of the tycoon games, Civ, or model railroads, this game's for you. You can raise the difficulty if you want a more hardcore planning-focused experience, or mod in some demand multipliers if just want to build some nice interchanges." , 1 , 13 , 0.674260497093200684 , 1 , 3 , 2017-02-02 20:18:37 , 2711

"The hours played doesn't reflect my experience with this game, as I used to play the disc version of this wonderful game religiously, and I still feel this to be one of the best city builders ever created. There was a time when Maxis had true freedom of their games (from when they were independent, and even the early days of being under EA), and during these times they released banger after banger - From the very first SimCity (and all other Sim games, I miss SimFarm and SimTower) up to SimCity 4 and Rush Hour, the studio and publisher were on fire and their games were of top-notch quality, and SimCity 4 is the result of them putting everything they learned up to this point into their city-builder series. There are very few builders out there that stand up to SimCity 4, it was just so enjoyable to make any kind of city you could dream and the addition of fun side-missions that let you actually drive vehicles around your city, and the ability to inspect your residential areas as well as name them if you please, was such a fun and intuitive addition to the franchise. Of course 4 is not without its flaws, but I have a hard time remembering what any of them are. EA may have destroyed their own franchise by making a mockery of the franchise with Sim City 2013, and City Skylines may currently be the premium city builder on the market while we're absolutely spoiled with solid choices like Urbek, Tropico, Anno, and Theotown among many others, but once upon a time Sim City 4 was king, and even today it has no problem showing that it is still relevant and as enjoyable now as it was back then." , 1 , 14 , 0.670355558395385742 , 0 , 0 , 2023-04-09 19:28:33 , 51

"Honestly this is probably my favorite game of all time. If you played the new SimCity and often thought Huh, that seems like a dumb feature, you'll probably find that SimCity 4 alleviates most of these complaints. In my mind, there are three key differences between this game and the newest SimCity:

1. Non-agent based simulation: SC4 instead opts for a big-picture, numbers-based simulation. You'll find that this opens up many features that are highly preferrable to the agent modelling in the new SimCity, while still maintaining an acceptable level of simulation. This leads into the next difference.

2. City / Region size: With the less intensive processing involved in all the population dynamics, cities and regions are MUCH larger than the new game. There are no bare spots between cities; the whole world is yours to control. Want to make a complex highway system, servicing key neighborhoods and moving high volumes of traffic? Go right ahead. Highways are woefully prebuilt in the new game. Would you instead like to focus on public transit? The options are all there and in greater depth than the new SimCity. As a result of the larger size, the game feels much more open to creativity despite the lack of curved roads.

3. Modding: While the newest game just recently announced support for offline mods, you'll find that SC4 is far better off in the modding community. Many overhaul mods are available to give more transit options, better modelling, more buildings, and other assorted features. If you don't like something about this game, it's likely there's a mod to fix it.

Those three features are the main reasons why SimCity 4 is a far more rewarding experience than the new SimCity will ever be. Considering all this, and that SC4 can be had for $5 very easily, why would you choose the new one?

It has everything from the peaceful zen of settling a farming village in rolling hills, carving out a bustling coastal metroplolis, or the dirty fun of managing the man-made mountains of your region's garbage city.

The modding community has really made this game shine. At the minimum I recommend the Network Addon Mod (NAM) because of the improved traffic simulator - even if you choose to not increase the road capacities or include new highway and rail components. A full NAM install will add a good bit of content, so choose carefully when doing a custom install if you dont want your menus to get too bloated.

I have also managed to get the game running smoothly on my modern hardware (3770k + Radeon 7850). This game is known to erroneously detect moden Radeon HD 7xxx series GPUs as the old non-HD 7000 series. In the game's GraphicsRules.sgr file I commented-out the entire section on radeon slow path for partial depth buffer copies and added a new rule for the AMD Radeon HD 7000 Slow-Down Fix posted in the simtropolis forums - this resolved choppy scrolling issues.

I also use the following launch options set in steam:
 -intro:off -CustomResolution:enabled -r1920x1080x32 -d:directx  -w -CPUcount:1

These options: disable intro, enable and set custom resolution, directX video output, windowed mode, use only one cpu." , 1 , 21 , 0.664930045604705811 , 0 , 0 , 2014-11-28 02:22:03 , 11199
"SimCity 4

Who doesn't know this feeling of nostalgia - the old games were better, gaming had real meaning when we first bought our desktop PCs and started installing games like SimCity. I had SimCity 3000 when I was a teenager. It had been such a hype and all I remember now is sucking at the game. I used to just load a random city and attempt to play it, ending up being bankrupt within half an hour. The feelings, though, when I found SimCity 4 on Steam was that longing. I had to buy it again. Surely, over the years, I would have improved my game knowledge so far that I would finally manage to build a city and lead it. Turns out that countless hours in Endless Legend, Northgard, and The Settlers has prepared me for nothing, because I still suck. 

This game is for players
- in love with the old Maxis interface. The blue interface is an homage to Sims 1 and is pure nostalgia
- looking for a tutorial. Trust me, you will need it
- who love city builders. This game has got it all and the randomly generated disasters are the key ingredient in any SimCity game
- who love everything old-school: graphics, open-ended scenarios, time vacuums

Look at the screenshots and tell me you do not feel the nostalgia oozing out of every picture. If you do not know what I am talking about, then go to the next title in your queue." , 1 , 13 , 0.664905309677124023 , 3 , 0 , 2020-04-23 10:32:56 , 53
"Who the hell doesn’t love a good city simulator? Just be nostalgic for a minute and remember your old middle school days spent huddled up in your room watching aliens destroy your precious creation that you were so proud of yet disappointing to your parents because you created something that couldn’t be taped to the fridge.  You get to be the oh so glorious mayor of Asshat-ville. Asshat-ville can become a glorious mecca if you, asshat, make it so. Create zones for industrial, commercial and residential buildings. Build roads and power lines and those train thingies no one ever uses. Although this game is for the glorious PC Master Race, the graphics aren’t all that glorious and the music will have you banging your head on your desk after a few solid hours. This classic SimCity rehash will have you happy to relive the good ole days, but if you’re looking for something a little more fancy, head over to Tropico for a more in depth gameplay. But if you’re just a fan boy looking for a nostalgia trip, then my dear asshat, this game is for you. 7/10" , 1 , 28 , 0.66321408748626709 , 0 , 4 , 2014-06-29 20:53:29 , 103
"Cities: Skylines has surpassed the former king, the Sim City series, however... SC4 is still a wonderful game, and well worth the price, especially on sale.

"I grew up with this game :) I read some of the negative reviews of this game to be objective.

Most of the not recommended recviews are about new hardware and Windows 10. I do not exactly know if the game works well with high end graphics and operating systems but i will assume it works after some work arounds.

Because if you can run this game and if you are a fan of city managing, this game is the most detailed game i know. Considering Cities XXL, Cities Skylines and City Worls. I am kind of a City building veteran :)

This game is pretty hard and complicated. You will most probably bankrupt you first 4-5 cities. you have to master the income and outcome balance and peoples happiness. Every desicion counts. Every single unit on the map is important. Reources management and city planing is crucial.

The game has advisors if there is something urgent to be adressed. And they might have good ideas too but do not go for all their ideas :) For example there are fires in the game and you have to dispatch units with your own hands. Sıo the advisor pops up and goes crazy in the middle of the screen. :)

The game has terraforming, water and air and noise pollution, land value and desirability to guide you. Neighbouring cities can exchange resources for income. Schools and hospitals are covering an area, so you have to adjust and optimize residential and commercial ares acoording to these two. Fire and police stations are also effective within their reach. But you can dispatch fire truck from a corner of the city to another.

Patient is the key to success in this game. Do not think you can just install the game and rise skylines. And i hope you can run the game on new operating systems and hardware." , 1 , 14 , 0.661827147006988525 , 0 , 0 , 2016-10-18 13:47:13 , 337
"When I bought this game half a year ago, I wasn't familiar at all with city-building games, but it was on sale and SimCity was of course a known franchise, so I bought it. When I started up the game for the 1st time I saw that I sometimes suffered from unexplainable graphical issues (colored lines ramdomly appearing on the screen). I went on. Then I noticed that the game sometimes chrashes (it happened to me about 10% of the times that I play it). I went on. Then I saw that I had been playing for hours. I went on.

This game is just so good that I dont't really mind these issues that I have from time to time. It is just so nice to start from scratch and create the city of your dreams (or the City of Death, for that matter). But that's just the start. After you're done with one city you will want to start up another neighboring city and connect both. and then a third city. And a fouth. There is just so much replayability because every city has different terrain. And while I can say that it's definetely not easy to make (and keep) your city healthy , it's not too complex to handle.

Since I bought this I have played more than 140 hours in 5 months time. For someone who also plays numerous other games, that's quite something. So yes, I'd definetely recommend this game if you have only a remote interest in city planning/management. It's already quite cheap normally, but when it's on sale there should definetely be no excuse for not buying this game if you think you will like it. It'll be worth the money." , 1 , 32 , 0.661728560924530029 , 1 , 0 , 2014-11-05 16:02:44 , 3858

There are some great mods on Simtropolis and SC4 Devotion for just about anything you can imagine. Mods add a lot of content to the base game and especially as far as the roads, they make it better.

I love how complex it's, yet still simple as the city develops itself and not micro-manage like SimCity Societies. As other reviews stated, it only utilizes 1 CPU core and its sim traffic behavior is horrible.

If you like SimCity and your PC is aged, you should try this one. If you have an Android phone, you can download TheoTown, which is the clone of this game but no enegy-like s*** system like other City Building games on phones.

Back To The Days When EA Didnt Have A Big Boner For Money, The Game Is Very Easy On Really Any PC That Is Able To Run Paint.exe And That Has More Than 2GB Of Ram.

The Game Is Great Even Tho It Is 15 Years Old And Still Alot Of A Fun Too. Its Great To Come Home After A Long Day At Work, Boot Up Spotify And Play Some SimCity™ 4.

"What to say about SC4... 

I first got this game back in the day when it first came out. I have NFC how many hours I truly have on it; the only reason I got it on steam is because the CDs that I needed to play the game no longer work :( IMHO SC4 is The best city builder out there with cities skylines taking a very very close second place. FFS for a game that came out in 2003 it is still enjoyable and still selling... If you like city builders and don't have it, I ask you WTF is wrong with you? IMHO SC4 and cities are the two best city builders out there, you should have both of them... Oh and I still have sim city clasic on my old ass windows 3.1 IBM PS/1 and it is still fun...

Oh and for the people who cry about graphics... what do you expect it came out in 2003. The game does not need to be uber pritty to be a good game. 
The ONLY issue I have with this game is the odd abort to desktop. This is simply because the game is not designed for multi core CPUs.

"Still the best city simulator on the planet.

It isn't just the (stroooooong) nostalgia, it is a very solid game.

Cities Skylines comes close, but this one just has a lovable flair to it, plus I prefer the grid-based building over the overly free one in CS.

The NAM mod is a mandatory addition, and in all honesty the modders should get 95% of all Steam income since they basically keep this game alive on their own almost 2 decades after release.

Oh and fuck EA sideways for holding this series hostage and butchering Maxis." , 1 , 14 , 0.615710020065307617 , 0 , 0 , 2017-11-22 14:48:56 , 3284
"Best city building game of all time. Although Cities Skylines has better road construction and water simulation, Simcity 4 has the better simulation regarding zone usage and land values. It also has a better difficulty curve, as you are constantly challenged regardless of your city size by a multitude of interesting problems (e.g. low land values in new cities, lack of education/tax base when transitioning to high tech industry or insufficient low wealth workers in rich suburbs) while cities in Cities Skylines always devolve into solving traffic issues as the main gameplay loop.

The game was developed in 2003 and visually still looks fantastic. Buildings are consistently scaled and themed when compared to the inconsistent buildings of Cities Skylines. The game can be temperamental on modern systems however. It's a good idea to look at various guides to configure the game prior to running it and remembering to save often." , 1 , 12 , 0.615481734275817871 , 0 , 0 , 2017-11-23 23:48:17 , 21366

"In my ongoing and likely futile effort to write a Steam review for every game in my library (#268 out of 612)... it's time for SimCity 4 Deluxe.

I'm fairly certain SimCity was the first video game I ever played. Back in gradeschool, it was one of the few acceptable titles for the compute lab due to its perceived educational value. I'm not sure what, exactly, we were meant to learn from it, but I have fond memories of fiddling around with power lines and hospitals and frustrating natural disasters all the same.

I'm not terribly keen on the simulation or city-building genres, so I can't speak much for the complexity of SimCity 4, or how well it lives up to or fails to live up to its predecessors, but I can say that it seems to play exactly as I remember, and is just as fun as I remember. One thing to note, however, is that it's very much an older PC game and it shows its age, most notably with the absence of tooltips. Honestly, going back to player older strategy games is kind of infuriating these days, due to the typical lack of tooltips. Conventional game design at the time seems to have revolved around abstract icons, which just... are never going to communicate a concept as clearly as proper text. So if you haven't played SimCity in a while, you're likely going to have to bludgeon your way through a fairly steep learning curve as you slowly decipher and memorize the game's arcane symbology.

Note: Also played on PC, sans-Steam." , 1 , 15 , 0.61127924919128418 , 3 , 0 , 2020-03-07 13:44:52 , 37

"When I think of SimCity, I think back to the time with Benjamin showing me the first part of SimCity. I just loved SimCity and took turns playing with Benjamin on a city that grew and grew. Unfortunately we both had problems with unemployment in the city and so Benjamin decided to build a neighborhood with four dozen police stations. To give the citizens all a job. So anyone who became unemployed in our city was immediately given a police badge and put in a patrol car. That was how Benjamin had solved unemployment.

SimCity 4 was the last great SimCity. It was a real step up from its predecessors because the city had a main map that was divided into smaller distinct quarters. This is how districts, suburbs and villages came into being, all of which were interconnected. So it was the first part of SimCity, connected to a city complex with many districts.

Innovations in this part are the automatic building functions, with which one no longer has to worry about sewers and power lines. The mayor´s advisors are also beautifully presented and give advice. Of course, the graphics have also been polished.

If you want, you can let your own Sim citizen move into a house and watch him as he lives in the city. It´s a bit like a built-in function to make SimCity 4 to the game The Sims - light

"SimCity 4 is a true masterpiece of city-building gaming that has stood the test of time. Its legacy is evident in the still-active modding community, even two decades after its launch, which speaks to the depth and richness of the game's history. The complexity of the simulation in SimCity 4 surpasses modern titles like Cities: Skylines and creates a fun and engaging challenge for players with each city they build that can last late into the game.
Playing SimCity 4 since Christmas 2003, I am still discovering new things about the game, like the fact that you can use the query tool on the wildlife and that they also run away from helicopters. The graphics may be dated now, but they haven't aged poorly due to the game's art style, which does a lot of heavy lifting. The richness of small details in SimCity 4 gives the game a warm and soulful feel that can be experienced in every play session.

The only downside to playing SimCity 4 is the realization of how EA could have gone so wrong with subsequent iterations of SimCity, when there was already a winning formula in front of them. Also, this isn't to say that Cities: Skylines is a bad game by comparison, as they are just two different types of games. While Cities: Skylines is a beautiful city diorama with a challenging traffic system, SimCity 4 is a complex urban simulator that requires strategic planning and balancing to get skyscrapers to develop.

The game's soundtrack is one of the best in gaming, with a range of tracks from the contemplative yet energetic No Gridlock, the absolute bangin sax action in Rush Hour, to the beautiful symphonies of Wheels of Progress and Morning Commute. As the pinnacle of city builders, SC4 has inspired a new generation of city planners/civil engineers and sparked a love of city design in me at the age of 7 that has lasted to this day. It is a must-play for any fan of city-builders.

With that being said, it is indeed possible to make this game somewhat stable on modern machines but you are going to HAVE TO install some mods (I-HT fix, 4GB patch and SC4Fix.dll) as well as set some startup parameters on the .exe" , 1 , 9 , 0.602636754512786865 , 0 , 0 , 2023-02-13 15:53:54 , 4695

"Ah sim city 4... the first game i played as a kid, even though back then every city i built went bankrupt.. but recently i brought it in steam because my disk copys have gone missing.. Now this game is fairly old, and doesnt like modern hardware so you will be finding yourself messing around with your settings to have a half decent frame rate, though this isnt much of an issue as theres ways to fix it.. Sim city 4 also has plenty of content includeing more then 15 map tiles to build a cities, we all know a game gave us a dismal amount. (Sim city 2013) Sim city 4 still has a fairly active modding community, with a 'f**k ton' of mods which has made the game constantly refreshing and intresting.. 

With that, sim city 4 is 14 years old and has its postive points and negitive points.. but is it worth it? Yes but also no. With the game 'not running at a friendly frame rate' due to modern hardware (includeing crashes) it may become quickly boring.. but dont let that over shadow how good this game is.. buy this at risk of knowing it may not work because of modern hardware.. but its worth it if you want a game that, you can sit down for hours on end buidling the city of your dreams" , 1 , 10 , 0.602247953414916992 , 1 , 1 , 2017-07-05 08:18:08 , 1152
"The first SimCity to really draw me in, SimCity 4 has more depth and complexity than any city building game before it, and even some made today!

Runs on anything, crashes at any point, but it will always be fun to monitor an old monster city or make a new one! There is something to be said about the isometric graphics and highly detailed texures/models. It has a very charming look to it, especially when you are pawing over your own emormous creation and adding what you think looks best!

With the addition of mods, this game is endless fun. Your cities can be insanely detailed and varied. Seriously though, especially since the game is so old and so many mods have been released, the combinations and possibilities are mind-boggling.

If it wasn't for the random crashing, especially when using mods, this game would be an instant 10.

This is one of the times I really lament the state of the Steam review system. It is difficult to give this game the rating it deserves based on a thumbs up and thumbs down alone. Skip the next two paragraphs for the TL;DR version.

The SimCity series used to be synonymous to the city simulator genre, kind of like Xerox and Kleenex are synonymous to photocopying and tissue paper respectively. This is an old game, so there will bound to be some minor issues running on relatively modern hardware, and back then, it was, at worst, tolerable, because nothing else came close. I had been playing this game even before Steam existed.

Then came the lackluster SimCity (2013) after years of waiting for its successor, and then a few years later, came the promising Cities: Skylines by a different company. This game was really good back then and aged gracefully way beyond any reasonable expectation largely thanks to its modding community, but ever since, I started playing Cities: Skylines two(?) years ago, I just never went back to SimCity 4.

In conclusion, any person new to the city simulator genre should probably skip SimCity 4 and go with Cities: Skylines instead. This game is really showing its age, modding it is a bit more involved, and the minor issues are still there. For anyone who is already into the genre but wants to have a more vintage experience or simply wants to go down memory lane, you cannot go wrong with this game. Given all that I have said, it is with an incredibly heavy heart that I no longer recommend this game for most." , 0 , 22 , 0.598674237728118896 , 1 , 0 , 2018-11-29 08:37:27 , 12
"This game is incredible. The Graphics are very detailed and realistic. You can build more than one city on the same map. Not to mention importing your own Sims from The Sims into the game. Your city just doesn't sleep like that of SimCity 3000. You see your people walking about and running their daily lives, like walking their dogs, Driving to the supermarket, Driving their kids to school even going to church!
The biggest improvement that I saw in SimCity 4 were the disasters. In SimCity 3000 you had like what? 4? In SimCity 4 you get over eight disasters. The best part is that you can control and decide where your Tornado goes. You also get Volcanoes that erupt, Erathquakes that bury houses and split open the earth, Meteor showers that leave everlasting craters and
Lightning Bolts, Fires, Riots, Floods, Mudslides, Bank Robberies and even Car chases. You get to choose you terrian styles. You can ahve an African style with Rhino's and Giraffes. Sometimes they can even stampede into your city.
The other great thing about SimCity 4 is the terrian tools. You can sculpt gorgeous, Lagoons, Cliffs, Craters, Valleys and even place galiciers. Then you have the time settings. A 1900's Chicago style, A 1950'S New York Style, And a 2000s Houston Style. Then there is the animations of the construction of buildings. When you build your buildings they just don't appear out of no where tou actually see your sims get into their work trucks and start to construct the building. And if the building is of no use anmore it decays and doesn't turn into a huge big purple borded up mess. Then if you want to destroy or knock down a building it just doesn't disappear, you can actually impload or expload your buildings from any side you wish. There are no old buildings from SimCity 3000, The're totally new realistic looking buildings in SimCity 4.
To me all this extra stuff makes this game totally anew. You won't get board if you like Simulation games." , 1 , 15 , 0.598424673080444336 , 0 , 4 , 2014-07-21 19:28:14 , 21070

"I should have paid attention to the reviews. Back in the day I was a huge SimCity fan, I played it for years through all of the versions through SimCity2000. For 5 dollars I thought it would be a nice nostalgic journey and I was wrong. It is nothing like the original and has none of the charm. Graphics suck, user interface sucks, help button sends you to a website that does not load, and there is nothing to recommend about it. Clearly a minimal amount of effort has been made to port an old game with no regard for it's original design.

"Regular price: £10 - Sale offer: £ 2.50 (i.e. get it you fool!)

Looks aren't everything, size doesn't matter and it is better to have loved and lost than never to have loved at all.

If your brain can comprihend the fact that a fifteen year old game does not have the resolution of a current game and you like to play around with city building sims, than buy this.

"[i](Scroll down my review to see technical tips to get the game running smoothly on Windows 10)[/i]

[h1]Gameplay Review[/h1]
Just as I remember it! Not everything has aged well but it's still quite fun. It still feels more challenging and deep in many areas than Cities: Skylines. The fact that there are three density levels rather than two and that lower densities can develop on high density zones if demand doesn't exist yet makes for more variation, and the fact that zoning costs money means that you aren't incentivized to only zone high densities because higher density zones cost more money. In C:SL I always ended up with unrealistic cities full of nothing but skyscrapers because there was no reason to zone low density once higher density was unlocked.

The vehicle missions are a nice touch. There's something oddly fun about driving around the streets of your own city even if it's just from an overhead perspective.

I also love the graphics. The pseudo 3D style allows much more visible detail than in C:SL.

And the music. Easily one of the best video game soundtracks in existence.

Only annoyances I have are fiddly road, rail, etc. construction, and unrealistically steep and jagged roads unless you spend time leveling them by placing adjacent single road tiles. 

Transport and traffic management is also less deep than C:SL.

8/10

[h1]Technical Tips[/h1]
If you're having trouble with crashes: close the game, and copy this line (including the dash): 
[i]-CPUCount:1[/i]
Then right click on the game in your library, click properties and in the window that pops up paste it into the box under where it says launch options. Since doing this I've yet to experience a single crash.

If you want to run it at 1920x1080 resolution then add this to that box as well:
[i]-CustomResolution:enabled -r1920x1080x32[/i]
You can probably do this with any resolution you want, just replace [i]1920x1080[/i] with the resolution you wish to run it at.

If you own a disc copy that won't work on Windows 10, It's very possible that the Steam version will still work for you (apparently Win10 can have trouble with older discs).

If you have problems with low FPS, try setting shadows to low in the in-game settings. Shadows seem to be a performance hog in this game even though they don't add much visually.

Edit: Also be sure to never press the button to save and quit (either to region or desktop) as this can cause the game to freeze and your save to be corrupted. Always save your city, then exit without saving." , 1 , 6 , 0.588937282562255859 , 0 , 0 , 2021-12-27 10:49:15 , 671
"Ah SimCity 4 Deluxe Edition, I had this game as a kid. It was without a doubt one of my favorite games growing up as well! If you love building cities, or managing a city, then SimCity 4 is perfect! The graphics have aged pretty well in my opinion. I'll never get sick of playing SC4. Since this is the Deluxe Edition you also get the Rush Hour expansion pack, Unlike SimCity 3000, 2000, and Sim City 5, in SimCity 4 you create a region, and then create cities, which you can connect all of your cities like in previous SimCity versions, but unlike previous SimCity versions, you're connecting roads, pipelines, and ect to other towns which you have created.

The developers really should work on this problem, but it doesnt look like they have any interest in doing so.  The game will intermittently freeze, and/or crash completely while playing.  So if you want to play it, try to save your work every few minutes.  Having said that, the concept is good, but the programming really needs to be updated, and I dont think the developers will ever do it." , 0 , 7 , 0.586171865463256836 , 0 , 0 , 2021-04-20 12:30:05 , 92404
"SimCity series are oldest city-building games, with the very first one released in 1989. The person who stands behind the idea is Will Right, a famous game designer who is also known for creating Sims series and Spore. By 2020s he left big industry for development of mobile projects but back in 2000s his name was often seen in videogame magazines. And since this man is one of most talented game developers of all time, all his games projects became either true hits in their genre or at least caused large discussions and attention. SimCity falls into first category. Unfortunately, by the time of writing this review the series are dead. And with SimCity reboot released in 2013 falling to achieve success this very game, SimCity 4, holds the title of the latest good SimCity game. I played it even back in 2000s and I must say that it's a true masterpiece. However, for newcomers it might look old, especially when there are such modern games like Cities Skylines exist. But for me this game means a lot and I personally think it's still fun to play." , 1 , 10 , 0.583337724208831787 , 0 , 0 , 2022-02-16 05:02:00 , 6001
"To any developers thinking about creating the perfect city building game (Paradox, I'm looking in your direction), here are some step by step instructions on how to do it right.  I'll list them in order below:

#1: take Sim City 4, and add curved roads
#2: graciously accept your GOTY award

Seriously, that is all. Take a 12 year old game and add some curves. Why does everyone screw this up?  Man, I wish I had programming skills." , 1 , 9 , 0.582956671714782715 , 2 , 1 , 2015-01-17 19:52:04 , 1698
"Growing up, I knew that I was destined to hold a position of power. As I was given the title of “mayor” I felt a great rumbling from deep within me. 

I dawned my 1950’s top hat and cane, using my servant to press the clicky clacky tippy typie on my mahogany desk. With a glass of scotch in one hand, and the bottled tears of a child in another, I raised land and oceans. I placed the poor far away from the city, giving them one school, which served as a labor camp for orphans who gave me sass. I chuckled, giddily, as each sip of alcoholic delight left me feeling more empowered. 

I raised taxes so high, even the rich began to cry. But I needed more. My mayoral hall and housing were surrounded by police who were paid handsomely, their salaries equivalent to the surgeons who worked at the privately constructed hospitals that were right next to my luscious abode. 

I chortled with glee as my advisors and secret police made sure everything fell in line. For the neighborhoods that tried to rise up against me, my board of shadowy figures and mother-in-law sacrificed several domesticated and localized goats to summon a space rock that decimated their homes and willingness to challenge me. 

I stood from my sitting device and performed a bodacious jig as I saw my profits double, my harvested uranium and potassium mines fueling my secret economy. My meals became more lavish, my attire woven from the flesh of the most endangered animals. 

Power is only a small descriptor. Godhood is a more accurate classification.

It just has the retro charme and it runs pretty damn fine for a game thats over 13years old by now. SimCity even supports 1080p resolutions so you can still play it decently with todays monitors.
The difficulty can be challenging to newer players, but by now I finally realized how to play it, other than 13years ago when i was just doing random stuff.

"If you are looking for a city builder with extremely well designed mechanics and gameplay, Sim City 4 is the game, without question.

Cities XL, other generic clones, and even Sim City 5, shouldn't even be compared with Sim City 4. You may think like Let's be honest, it's outdated., and you would be so wrong. It is not, and probably won't be outdated, just like Mario Bros, Tetris, or Pac-Man.. Sim City is the very first initial applicaton of city building (both in terms of management mechanics and sandbox mode.), and Sim City 4 is the absolute peak of series. While even vanillia game is a very good experience, various mods which are still being created (After +10 years the game is released.)(Which on it's own is a proof of how well mechanics are made.) regularly, provides you anything you could ever wish for.

I almost can't find any possible upgrade ideas for Sim City 4 (While some mods are included.), except some graphical fidelity - and the fact that these 10 year old graphics are exceptionally good for its time (You can apply some recent HD texture packs, too!), it won't be bothering you at all. Actually, in my opinion, 2,5D graphics are pretty optimal for such game. There are some pretty obvious cases like Stronghold Crusader & Stronghold II / StarCraft:BW & StarCraft 2, where 2,5D to 3D transition actually killed the uniqueness of gameplay. Even in the case of SC, when I exclude the mechanical differences of SC5 with SC4, gameplay is also kind of degraded. With so much going on in terms of gameplay, you may, and probably will be looking for some simplicity in terms of graphics which lightens the load in your brain, and SC4 has that.

If you are someone who is looking for a top quality city building game, here is the absolute starting line.
If you are someone who is into that genre, and you didn't played SC4...well...better late than never!" , 1 , 4 , 0.581749081611633301 , 0 , 0 , 2014-02-13 06:59:16 , 1233
"With nearly 200 hours played, countless cities setup, and regions created... I have nothing to show for it. Not because I do not think the game is worth playing but because my anxiety makes me restart everything and I just do not want to play it anymore. I have nothing to show for it because the game triggers my anxiety all the time about laying out cities correctly and how to create an economy that works while setting up the city to be pollution free. I do not use mods or cheats when I play so it can be very daunting to make some of the choices in the game to keep everyone happy. The Advisors are never satisfied. This game is not to be played if you want fast results. Building regions and cities takes time… a lot of time and careful consideration and they change as the region grows and the demands increase.

If you like city builders, this is probably the best one out there and the best one in the SimCity series of games. It is simple yet complex and has little frills. I recommend it for anyone who like to design cities and deal with their problems such as planning, traffic, healthcare, power, and water regulation needs. I do not recommend it for anyone who has anxiety or OCD since the game offers limited flexibility as the buildings and objects are based on grid squares. I do not believe (at least I never found out how to do it) you can rotate buildings so they face a certain way which can get a little frustrating.

To be fair the game is still great even though it was originally released in 2003 and is almost 20 years old at the time of this review.

Overall, I would play it again… but I would still have nothing to show for it.

"Simcity 4 is an outstanding game. I have grown up all my life with Simcity, and by far, this is the best game in the series. Compared to Simcity 3000, this game is a huge step up. 
Clearly aimed at experienced, PC gaming, simulator loving gamers, Simcity can satisfy all of the requirements that are needed to make a great city simulator, and does so much more to interest the player. 

The game is orientated around grittier city building, or large gleaming metropolises, which, to a long term player, is a great change from the previous installments - where the design choices and city genres seemed somewhat limited. 

With so many buildings to choose from, you may expect a steep difficulty curve, which indeed is apparent as you play the game. However, there is a certain satisfaction as your first high-rises begin to develop! 

In my opinion, an important factor in gaming, is the music, as it creates most of the atmosphere. Simcity 4 does impress; it impresses a lot. The ambient music in the regional view, combined with the gritty, hard jazz in the mayor view, combine to create an incredible atmosphere, incomparable to previous entries in the series, despite the impressive jazz tracks in Simcity 3000. My favorite track in the game, known as ‘Zone System’ is an example of the perfection of ambient, gritty, depressing, but most of all, interesting, city-sounding music. It sets the atmosphere of the game perfectly, and captures the player’s and the sim’s emotions as you expand your corrupt city into a gleaming paradise. 

Another selling point of the game is the implementation of features from The Sims. While these features are not necessary, they add a certain charm to the game. They allow the player to drive cars, fly planes, ride boats, control trains, or even drive a tank whilst destroying buildings with missiles. 

An important part of gaming is certainly the graphics and aesthetics, and Simcity 4 does not disappoint. The graphics, while pixelated once zoomed in, are amazing. Loads of buildings have interesting features, even with customized gardens or small details such as cars. The view of the game is isometric, and the player can rotate the view by 90 degrees, in order to see parts of the map that may be hidden. This is an important feature, especially when working around hills. What I would have liked though is a feature where the player could view the map from birds-eye-view, but I can understand there may have been hardware limitations back in 2003 that may have made this impossible. 

Simcity 4 gives the player access to many natural disasters and scenarios. Meteorites, tornadoes and earthquakes can be summoned by the player at any time, along with many other disasters. An example of an interesting scenario is if a nuclear power plant explodes, causing a lot of radiation to be expelled into the city. This can be interesting if the player wants a challenge, or just fun to destroy a huge metropolis! 

Simcity 4 does have a few problems however, though not major if you know how to overcome them. The most prominent problem is the commute time being too difficult to manage. 

Another issue is the constant industrial demand, where the player would need to build huge cities dedicated only towards industrial. This can be rather boring, as industrial development is limited, but can be improved by adding a mod that quarters the industrial demand. 

Overall, an awesome game." , 1 , 14 , 0.581032335758209229 , 1 , 0 , 2019-08-01 10:20:24 , 3382

"+++++++++++++++ Review +++++++++++++++

This is THE greatest city builder of all time. Today's reiterations like Cities: Skylines can't touch the beauty and intricacy of this game. Its 2.5 Dimension style graphics style will probably never be seen again, and it's something you'll have to experience to appreciate. 

Note that there's a huge difference between 'SC4' and a 'heavily modded SC4' - the community is still very much so alive on Simtropolis and SC4 Devotion, making great free addons to this game with real world buildings, restaurants, road addons, landmarks, trees and everything else you can imagine. Hardcore players of SC4 are typically sandbox builders and don't care for the actual game aspect - you can create some pretty mind blowing scenery with this game and the right mods. With that being said, it's a game with an insane amount of replay value...not just beacuse it has no end, but it's a relaxing scenery builder that will give you a great deal of therapy through the years.

+++++++++++++++ About the Steam Version of Sim City 4 +++++++++++++++

If you're like me and have been playing SC4 from the original disc, it's worth re-purchasing it through a Steam sale to get this patched version, because SC4 does not work well from the get-go. You will need to do a little work to get the game to run on Windows 10, but this will simply take a couple minutes...here's what you need to know:

+++++++++++++++ Getting Sim City 4 To Run On Modern Day PCs +++++++++++++++

The version of Sim City 4 DX that you get from Steam is 1.1.641.0, which means that the old EP1 Update (UPDATE_SKU1_TO_P1.EXE) and SC4Update4BAT (SC4Update4BAT.EXE) are already included, and you won't have to hunt them down on the internet. These patches were necessary if you had the old CD version of the game; otherwise, buildings would not light up during the night time cycle.

Once you install the game, you'll have to edit its Steam launch options, which is pretty quick and easy:

- In Steam, click LIBRARY in the main menu.
- Next, right click SimCity 4 Deluxe in the right-side menu, and choose Properties
- Right within the GENERAL tab is a button called SET LAUNCH OPTIONS... - click it.
- In the field provided on this final pop-up, paste in the following variable string:

-w -intro:off -CustomResolution:enabled -r1920x1200x32 -CPUCount:1 -CPUPriority:high

(These variables are: -w (wide screen), -intro:off (skips past the annoying intro that runs every time the game opens, -CustomResolution:enabled -r1920x1200x32 (this tells the game to run at your monitor's resolution, change it if you have to), -CPUCount:1 -CPUPriority:high (this is the most important part...Sim City 4 cannot run on more than 1 core, so you have to force the program to run on only one. Otherwise, the game won't run).

+++++++++++++++ Getting Mods for Sim City 4 +++++++++++++++

Mods make this game what it is - you won't believe how different it will look once you've added some custom content. The two best sites on the internet for mods are Simtropolis and SC4Devotion. Even after all these years, the communities for SC4 are thriving on these sites. They'll also have plenty of resources that tell you exactly how to unpack and install mods - it's pretty easy.

The essential mods you'll really want (or have?) to get are:

- NAM (Network Addon Mod): adds a ton of new realistic roads, interchanges, ramps, etc.
- SC4 DAT Packer: makes the game more stable by centralizing your mods into one big file
- Cheats By Buggi: allows you to input a bunch of different cheats that will make your life easier if you're looking to play this game in sandbox mode

+++++++++++++++ Standalone Mods for Sim City 4 +++++++++++++++

There are two notable standalone mods for Sim City 4. They install as separate programs:

- SC4 Terraformer: this program is really old and a little clunky, but it will all you to hand sculpt a Sim City 4 map by drawing mountains, valleys, hills, etc with your mouse across any or all regions - even over borders, which is impossible to do in-game. The regions can then be imported into your game.

- SC4 Mapper: This program lets you modify the size of the regions in a current Sim City 4 map. If you wanted regions to be bigger or smaller, or if you wished that the borders of a certain region were located somewhere else (like, one region on your map that is not 90% water and 10% land), you can edit them with this program." , 1 , 9 , 0.575696825981140137 , 1 , 1 , 2016-09-15 12:57:40 , 35

Still an amazing city builder at over a decade later. IMO its superior to all of the new games spawned under the SimCity franchise, even with some older/technical limitations. Region play allows you to make some truly massive megalopolises. Mods like the NAM fundamentally change the game in positive ways and the amount of custom buildings, terrain and flora on community sites is mind-numbingly large.

The only gripe I have about this game is the performance. Being an older DX app, it's limited to single core and 4GB of RAM. Crashes and performance issues are abound on modern hardware, and it doesn't seem like EA would ever willingly release the source code of the game.

"Pretty much the best citybuilder and one of my most played games of all time. I own a physical copy of it, and I recently picked up this Steam copy... definitely one of my favorite games ever.

You need to mod the game in order to make it playable, and the game tends to crash, lock up, and run slowly. There's no autosave and you'll probably lose a lot of hours of gameplay. Loading a custom region is cumbersome, installing mods is archaic, and the whole thing is just clunky. Using some mods will require literal hours of patience... ask me about custom highways or building a mass transit network. Piece by piece, slowly, surely, but satisfyingly.

Beneath all the clunk is a diamond, the absolute best city builder of all time. Every game that comes out can't seem to match a well-modded Simcity 4. You can install a massive amount of options for mass transit and building variety. It's intoxicating, if you're into it.

If you just want to build a pretty city, you're going to need to work slowly and learn how to do it. This game honestly isn't friendly or accessible for new people... But if you work at it, and you enjoy the genre, you're going to love it." , 1 , 30 , 0.570672512054443359 , 3 , 0 , 2014-10-07 23:44:19 , 6567

Still waiting on that next great city builer sim, though...Cities: Skylines came close, but it's just not what I'm looking for. How many more years will it be before someone steps up and makes a better city sim than this? It's not looking very likely at this point. 

One thing I like about this game is the realism. You zone land, it starts constructing, then you have plausible buildings start to pop up. Something I can't stand about modern city simulators is this cheesy, colourful, unrealistic look it has.

"After all these years, and all the city builder sims that have came after it, SC4 is STILL the gold standard for city building sims everywhere. Even with as good of a game as City: Skyline is, and it does some things way right, and has things I wish SC4 had, (like districting, and road building) is still doesn't feel as deep or as compelling as SimCity4 does. I fell that's it's way too easy to hit a ceiling in City: Skyline. After a while, I get a sense that I've done all I can do and have nowhere do go but start a new city, and start all over again. Meanwhile, in SC4 there are always new things to tackle and new problems to fix. I spend most of my time playing SC4 staring blankly at my screen, pondering my next move like a chess master. That's what I love the most about this game.

It makes you think.

The only drawbacks about this game is the frequent crashing. This was an issue that was present with original disk I had of this game way back in the day, but it now seems exacerbated on the Steam version. It will crash about ten or so minutes into the game about 40% of the time. This is beyond annoying and breaks any concentration you might have if you're constantly worried about saving. Also, I found that certain mods run a lot less seamlessly with the Steam version of the game as well. Perhaps I need to look a little more into this, but a lot of the highway mods I loved using on the disk version of the game, really tug the game down. I excepted the Steam version of the game to run much better which was why I bought it instead of buying a used diskset like I've done before in the past. I dunno whether to blame Steam or EA for the game's performance, but I assume it turn a lot of younger player away from this game when the game has real troubles running for more than a half an hour.

If you're willing to pop the hood and get your hands dirty, this is the last true SimCity title. EA owned Maxis by this point, but the company had SimCity 4 already in development beforehand and was able to release the title with little interference from their new abusive parent company.

Until... until I rised up as well. I mean - psychically. I am now 23 years old and my brain works a lot better than 10 years ago. I had improvement my strategic thinking, so my cities can grow even more.

"At $20, it's hard to recommend a game from 2003, which is basically ancientware at this stage. However, if you're patient and don't mind consulting Simtropolis a ton, this game still offers plenty of fun and value. 

Positives:
+The soundtrack is spot-on 
+Planning and building and watching cities grow is addictive
+Endless customizability
+Huge regions (even if you can't play everything at once due to hardware restrictions) makes it feel more real
+Lots of ways to play - from rural / farming, small-medium-huge cities, landscaping and decorating, modding and modeling, etc.
+Supportive and active community on Simtropolis

Minuses: 
-Built-in mechanics can be annoying, but modded away
-Doesn't run all that quick even on modern hardware (I can only speak for laptops)
-Getting and installing and organizing all the files and dependencies for mods is a hassle
-Learning NAM (the traffic mod) is a big pain, with tons of menus and clogged choices and such
-To fill up even a small region could take ages

All in all, I'd buy it on sale IF you already know and love it. For people who've never played this kind of game before, $20 is steep for this old of a game, period.

It's from a bygone era when we were kids, willing to stare at barely anything happening for hours on end. I love SimCity 4 nostalgically but by modern standards it's a boring idle game. Like watching a garden grow, or paint dry. Once you've seen one blocky block of apartment blocks you've seen them all.

Even if you keep yourself busy, most of your time is spent adjusting the city budget, gradually increasing funding for schools and clinics. It's such boring and menial spreadsheet work. Just like being a real mayor. The underlying problem being that the game's all numbers. It doesn't actually simulate anything, just applies some equations on economic values and then screams at you for being negative.

But its biggest flaw is that terrain doesn't matter. Not having to work around obstacles or build industry at resource locations just means that everything will be covered by a homogenous carpet of infinitely tiling mixed zone blocky city blocks." , 0 , 10 , 0.548563599586486816 , 3 , 1 , 2022-12-06 15:29:39 , 107

Not only do you manage your city, but your city is just one of many within a wider region. You build up these cities separately, connecting them together to share jobs, housing, and utilities, to form a wider metro area.

No multiplayer sessions unfortunately, which would have been fun, what with the deals cities can make. And to make a region with another, you have to share either the files, or the computer... if you share the files, only one person can make use of them at a time.

You might ask yourself: city building must sure be boring. You little fool, you have no idea what you're missing.

I won't go into detail as there would be too much to tell, but its worthy to mention that in the end, you can crash all your hard work by calling a giant robot to destroy the city... or maybe spawning a volcano in the middle of downtown.

The first downside of Simcity 4 is that, unlike its noble competitor C:S, it is purely isometric: you can turn your camera 90° but that's it. Point to C:S.

In this one you can zone your commercial/industrial/residential areas at will and the game will optimize roads within the zone. Wait... point for SC4 O.o

Well, if we compare the variety of roads, CS wins for sure. But SC4 has way more types of zoning. Draw.

Also, SC4 allows you to go control specific cars and go out on MISSIONS! Point for SC4 again!
SC4 also has Mayors, trying to advise you how to improve your city... plus the graphics and statistics of your city are way more meaningful than what C:S shows you.

Apart from graphics, SC4 aged super well. If you liked C:S you will probably like this one as well. No achievements, but also, no DLCs. Gah, take my thumbs up already!

"So I was browsing a forums post on SC4 steam page and saw someone describe how to fix the constant crashing and play in 1080p on Windows 10. I did both of those things, and man I have been having an absolute blast with this game again. As a nostalgia junky, I love the feeling of sitting back in my living room for hours on end in 2005 playing this game on the family computer, except I understand way more about civics, government and urban development! So as far as the game goes, there's a bunch of things this game does so much better than Cities: Skylines. As an American, I have more attachment to the SC4 art style vs CS; as the game feels more aesthetically American. To the houses, sky scrapers, industry buildings, and service buildings; they look more realistic than what you get in CS. I also appreciate what the regions aspect does to city building, as the economy of adjacent towns you control will effect the region as a whole. So while you want to make a city of a million sims right away, you have to really nurture your region into a megalopolis. Something that the isolated CS builder is missing. I also feel like the budgeting is more challenging than other city builders, but misses the depth of CS ordinances/districts. It may sound like I hate CS, but it's one of my favorite games of all time. SC4 is just that good. If you're into simulators or city builders, SC4 is quintessential!

[*]Make sure you get the deluxe version or at least [I]Rush Hour[/I] as they improve gameplay, add some stuff, and fix quite a few bugs.
[*]Game is a bit unbalanced. It helps to use cheat codes and some ini-tweaking but it's not necessary.
[*]Mods. There are hundreds of thousands of mods available. Mods that revamp all roads, add new transportation types, overhauls all zone types, agricultural overhauls, building mods, etc. There are a lot of mods available.

"SimCity™ 4 Deluxe Edition promises an immersive city-building experience, but unfortunately, it's marred by frequent crashes. Like many others, I've encountered frustrating interruptions during gameplay, leaving me feeling disappointed and discouraged.

Despite its potential for captivating city management gameplay, the persistent crashes detract from the overall enjoyment. It's disheartening to invest time and effort into building your city, only to have your progress interrupted by technical issues.

While SimCity™ 4 Deluxe Edition has its merits, the prevalence of game crashes significantly impacts the player experience. Until these issues are addressed, it's difficult to fully recommend diving into the world of urban planning with this title." , 0 , 8 , 0.551746249198913574 , 2 , 0 , 2020-06-14 13:17:17 , 38
"Mac version not recommended.  It was clearly an afterthought and even simple features such as importing heightmaps or custom regions are not supported.  Most mods will not work.

Gameplay in general is enjoyable but not as engrossing as I remember classic Sim City being.  

U Drive It missions are terrible.  The interface is clunky and slow to respond, and while you're trying to learn how to drive thrings around your city your failed missions cause you to lose money, reputation and sometimes even city features.

For the price I can't recommend it." , 0 , 17 , 0.551345765590667725 , 2 , 1 , 2016-04-28 11:25:53 , 499

"Its a shame that Maxis want bad and died. Id hoped the series would continue to inspire young minds with games about building and nurturing something, and then optionally destroying it.

This iteration of Simcity is in soul the last and in my opinion most engaging and merciful of them all. It has plenty of quality community mods that have been around for ages for those who would want to pile more detail and micromanagement on a game thats already everything to do with micromanagement. I tried Cities, its not bad, but the game play is simply not intensive and micromanagey enough for me.

"SimCity 4 (with the addition of Rush Hour) is still my favorite city building game, and I have Cities Skylines. Sure, at times it can be maddeningly frustrating when the game makes certain vehicle missions neigh impossible to complete, and there are the random crashes, but the attention to detail in the art and sprite animations are a delight, and there's nothing quite like growing a Podunk farming town into a regional high-tech mega city. The U-Drive-It missions add an element of playfulness that I feel is missing from Skylines. Despite being almost 15 years old this game is still fun and has an active modding community, so try it!

"I am a 45 yo father, probably one of the oldest people playing this game. I am a single father to my Son, who is 14 now. My son got this game from his uncle, so we installed it on his computer and he started playing. By the end of the week he had 24 hours on this game. This was horrible for me, as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just watching YouTube. So I decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. I loaded into the game, picked my character and world and started playing but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he hosted a game for me to join. I loved it as it was the best time I had spent with my Son since my wife had died. This game has ever since brought me and my son closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house together as well. This game reminded me that there's fun to be had in everything, and it has brought both me and my Son many happy memories." , 1 , 95 , 0.549521565437316895 , 12 , 23 , 2023-05-09 16:26:28 , 1530

"Recommended to new Sim fans.  I remember years ago, playing the original Sim City and many of it's decendants. (Sim City 2, Sim City 3, Sim Chopper, etc) This used to be one of those games you would play for just a few more minutes - then next thing you know it's 3AM and you have to work the next day. I bought Sim CIty 4 Deluxe with a bit of fond nostalgia,  and soon enough I was looking at familiar yet different screens. In the older versions you had to build water and electric infrastructure, connect power across roads, and make sure you had sufficient plants to take care of all that. This version has a bit of that but it all seemed somewhat... tamer? Anyhow, with the advent of the internet and multi-player gaming I can see how this could be a good way to kill time with some friends, but for a single-player I think the older versions had something that was a bit more engaging. I read about a bunch of bugs this version is supposed to have, but I didn't run into any yet, so I think Steam did a decent enough job of patching it - or perhaps the bugs just aren't that noticable. The controls were all reponsive and with a bit of practice I learned where all the hidden menus were tucked away. I just don't think I will be spending that much time on this game, but for the price (under $5) it was worth it to me." , 1 , 2 , 0.547697365283966064 , 0 , 0 , 2014-11-30 17:11:25 , 202

"SimCity 4 is not like SimCity 3000 in a few areas, but in most parts the gameplay is still the same. In SimCity 4 your budget is now fugured monthly, so it becomes even more important to get a good foothold quickly, and you need to be very careful in how you fund civic services, and keeping the city compact enough to allow for the radi of police, fire, schools, and any clinics or hospitals to fully grow to get the best bang for your simloins, as the tresurary can be depleted before you know it if you just build the serveces and not manage it correctly. Adjust funding as needed, and keep an eye to the news ticker, or to your various HUD's to know when something needs looking into so you can get on the job quickly. If funding remains too low for too long your sims might go on strike, which is not a good thing, as it hurts you mayor rating. You will want to keep the mayor rating well above -30 to prevent riots. If you do not have fire protection early, the first thing that could catch fire is the power plant, and if that burns down, then your city is in the dark. Do not wait until a fire breaks out to place a fire dept down. The tutorals will guide you through the basics of the game, and afteer you finish the tutoral, you can play the city like normal. Some aspects can be difficult, like getting one way streets to flow correctly can be a challenge at times and requires some trial and error. If you ever feel that the city is sinking too fast, you can always wipe it out and start new with a clean slate. If you made changes to the city before creation, those changes will stay, as will any trees that spawn in the city or that you have planted before or after city creation. There is more than just one city you can build in one region, and depending on how the region map generates there can be as many as 80 cities in the area for you to build. A true megaoplis can be built in SimCity 4 with all of its surrounding suburbs like a real major city." , 1 , 2 , 0.547325074672698975 , 0 , 0 , 2018-01-18 14:06:12 , 30

City Builder of its time.

Simcity 4 is the fourth followup in the detailed and engaging city builder series Simcity. Simcity 3000 and 4 are the only the ones I've played and generally see them on par as each other, whilst Simcity 4 is more detailed, there are some certain quirks that I dislike about 4 (i.e. vanishing traffic).

However, like Simcity 3000, Simcity 4 bathes in interaction, immersive sound and introspection.

"I know it's old, but this is perhaps EA's BEST rendition of the SimCity legacy to date. I played the new one on Origin quite a few times, played through many cities, and while I admit, the graphics might be a little more up-to-date in that version (I'm honestly not sure how to refer to it beyond the Origin version), and its gameplay might be a bit simpler, they killed a major element of SimCity with it. If nothing else, the areas you can play with in the Origin SimCity are TINY compared to what you get in SimCity 4. Yes, you play several of them in one region, but in SimCity 4, you get many HUGE areas to play with. It reminds me of EA's other major accomplishment, The Sims, in this way: by providing players with seemingly endless opportunities to keep playing, be it with a new city (new family in Sims) or by continuing to develop a city or group of cities to your heart's content. 

EA did this with Sims, too: instead of taking what's good about a game being consistent with it, they reinvent it over and over and it's basically a gamble of whether or not you're going to enjoy it again. They did the same with Sims. But anyway, if you haven't played SimCity 4, I'm happy to personally recommend it because except maybe approachability, it's great fun.

Not as modern as a game like Cities: Skylines but it's still good fun and a tad more difficult + way more complex!
A recommendation if you've owned this before, but the soundtrack alone is worth the money!

Do get the third party launcher to make it render properly on modern computers!" , 1 , 2 , 0.54356849193572998 , 0 , 0 , 2021-09-24 12:42:39 , 1022
"This game is purely awesome! Simcity was ambitious for its time, Simcity 2000 was EVEN BETTER than the first game, Simcity 3000 was a serious mind-f$%k of competence and is super fun, then Simcity 4 came and my jaw dropped to the floor. This graphics are 3D, there was more stuff to do, it doesn't run on DOSBox, and it's just more fun in general. Also, the music is near perfect! The music is so ambient and happy. Although the music isn't as good as Spore's ambient composed music, it is STILL good. I recommend this game HARDCORE, this is a MUST-PLAY game. Don't wait, don't delay, don't hesitate, BUY THIS GAME NOW! 10/10" , 1 , 2 , 0.54356849193572998 , 0 , 0 , 2019-11-03 16:01:12 , 175
"I have played Citylife and Cities in Motion and Cities XL, but none of them compare to SimCity 4. WARNING - If you play SimCity 4, you will not be able to play other city building simulations because SimCity 4 is really that good. Forget about SimCity 5 - they ruined it. Stick to SimCity 4. There are some excellent mods that better balance the game and add new roads and buildings. This is a very addicting game, and even though it is old, it is still the best.

"If you say Childhood. I say SimCity 4
This game is one of my all time favorite games, and I can only recommend it to gamers who like to watch over an echonomy, and to see a city rise and fall as you direct what's happending in the game.

If you're completly new to SimCity 4 and only know it's a city building simulator. Oh boy, there's so much more you can do with this game! Because not only will you be manageing a city. With the Deluxe Edition of the game you'll be able to drive certain vehicles, and decide for yourself wether to crash it, and watch it explode. Or drive carefully with the help of a SHIFT click on a road.

The game itself offers a look inside what running a city would be like. Simplyfied of course since you see everything from the perspective of a godlike mayor.
One side of the game that I want to really point out is the economy side. In many games alike SimCity 4 You've been able to changes taxes... And that's it! However in SimCity 4 you get to control Every aspect of the Tax income. You can even legalize gambling, and with an economy system that just works, as soon as you understand just a tiny bit of it.

"This game strikes me as a crossover between classic Sim City and Cities:Skylines, because I can see that Skylines took everything that was loved and familiar from Sim City 4, left out everything that didn't work, and optimized everything else to make it the best possible playing experience for the player.

Right, here's the biggest issue I have with this game. How/why is it that Sim City 3000 has better graphics and a better camera angle than this game? Did this come out before or after 3000? And why is Sim City 3000 not on Steam, but this game and Sims 4 are?

Oh yeah, and after clocking in 37 hours on the game, the app became unresponsive and wouldn't boot up. So that's fun, I guess I'll just go back to Skylines then.

I guess I'd recommend it if you wanted to play an older and more difficult version of Skylines. But beware of bugs and problems, as evidently I'm not the only person who has had issues trying to run this game." , 1 , 3 , 0.541807293891906738 , 0 , 0 , 2024-01-26 07:16:45 , 795

I haven't played the Steam release as much but I used to spend hours upon hours on the disc-based version of the game. However, I still love making experiments with cities and see how they turn out. What would happen if there was no mass transportation in this city? What if there was no education? What if there was only one road? Etc..

Slowly and surely after playing city after city I see a huge megalopolis develop with large airports, extensive monorail routes and lots of freeways.

"At this point, SimCity 4 is a creaky classic, but still a classic. If you're considering a citysim game you should weigh this alongside its predecessor SimCity 3000 and its figurative successor [url=http://steamcommunity.com/id/trar/recommended/255710]Cities: Skylines[/url]. If you already love the game, it's probably worth a Steam purchase if you haven't already. If you're still undecided, read on.


SimCity 4 was and still is commonly regarded as the pinnacle of its series by citysim enthusiasts. With the release of Cities: Skylines though, many of those same enthusiasts have seen that game as the new king of the genre. After a decade and change, SC4's life as the sole premier citybuilder came to an end.

However, SC4 still delivers a great citybuilding experience with enjoyable depth, graphics that still hold up well, and excellent music to listen to. Whether you should actually [i]play[/i] it depends on your affinity for the SimCity series, your attitude towards its complexity and your appetite for tinkering with the game to get it working.


SC4 is unquestionably the deepest, richest SimCity game, but for more casual players it can probably get too complicated. The game was released in 2003, and it doesn't play nice with newer computers. It's easy enough to get it running smoothly if you're technically inclined.

Custom mods truly bring the game to life, but each one has to be manually downloaded and configured. This can become annoying if not downright anal when you take into account the multiple separate dependency files that contain textures, items and other things that most mods use; a holdover from the waning days of dial-up internet...that morphed into creator pride which refused to allow the distribution of files with the mods that [i]actually used them[/i]. Also, if you don't organize your plugins folder, hunting down trouble with your plugins can be a nightmare.

If none of that sounds appealing? SimCity 3000 is older, but it delivers the series' best balance of accessibility and challenge. Meanwhile, Cities: Skylines is easier to run, has Workshop support for mods and takes inspiration from SC4 while improving on it in certain aspects. With the release of additional expansion packs, patches and Workshop mods, its depth may come to rival and even surpass SC4's, all while still maintaining a little more accessibility. Skylines however has a large number of DLCs, whereas SC4 had only one expansion which is included in the Deluxe Edition - definitely lighter on your wallet.


It's not a totally outmoded game, either. SimCity 4 does citybuilding a bit different than Cities: Skylines; it ultimately has a bigger scope and feel than Skylines offers, which might be more appealing to some. Other than that, its primary draws at this point are it's complexity if you're into that, the pedigree of its series, and its region play. If you already know you don't like SC4's region play I guess that won't matter to you.

Skylines gives you the option of purchasing more land to make into new districts, and the amount of land can be increased with mods. SC4 though gives you entire geographical regions of varying sizes to build multiple interconnected cities on, not to mention the capacity to download others' or make your own.

Region play is fascinating and very in-depth, which enhances the depth of the actual citybuilding. Unfortunately, there's no option to build a singular city by itself like in Skylines or previous SimCity titles, and you pretty much need to start other cities to have them grow past a certain point.

There are a couple things SC4 lacks, though. It lacks truly curved roads like in Skylines, and it doesn't have a lot of focus on walkability (an important aspect of modern urban design) without the addition of user-made mods. It also doesn't have mixed-use zoning, a sign of SimCity's roots in outmoded mid-20th century urban planning...though to be fair Skylines lacks this too, and you can always combine residential and commercial zones in any given block for something approximating it.


SC4 has over a decade's worth of custom content from its dedicated community, some of which is truly excellent & high-quality and extends the game considerably. Having a lot of mods however makes the game slower and sometimes more prone to errors, and you still need to manually download and place them in your plugins folder, so choosing and organizing them strategically is advised. If you're into it enough, it's worth it to go to [url=https://www.sc4evermore.com/index.php/downloads/category/22-dependencies]the dependency section on SC4Evermore[/url] and download everything there so you don't have to hunt for them when you download a mod.


Ultimately, even with minimal user-made mods SimCity 4 stands tall as one of the best of its genre, having only been really surpassed in any way by Cities: Skylines some 12 years after its release. If you've never played SC4 but decided it's for you, there are a couple things you should keep in mind.

As mentioned above, the game's decades old and can be somewhat unstable on newer machines. The game still chugs when running large cities. To optimize the game, I recommend the tips on [url=https://www.pcgamingwiki.com/wiki/SimCity_4]this page[/url]. I also recommend saving your cities often in any case.

You [b]absolutely need[/b] a couple of mods to fix up the game and make it playable. The Network Addon Mod in particular unscrews the traffic algorithms so your transit network doesn't degenerate into a kafkaesque nightmare. There's a couple other quality-of-life fixes floating around, like the [url=https://community.simtropolis.com/files/file/30883-sc4fix-third-party-patches-for-sc4/]DLL fix[/url] or the [url=https://community.simtropolis.com/files/file/21342-opera-house-fix/]Opera House fix[/url] that aren't [i]as[/i] important, but still go a long way towards making the game more playable." , 1 , 1 , 0.539969801902770996 , 0 , 0 , 2011-05-04 15:24:26 , 1217

"Still my favourite city sim, even though it's a bit dated, and it's a crashy mess on modern computers! Maybe that's nostalgia talking. At any rate, having the game crash while you're saving in case it crashes, is not fun. I really wish EA had put some effort into making it work, before adding it to Steam. Maybe they don't even have the original code any more? IDK.

At any rate, that makes it hard to entirely recommend, especially as they're still charging £10 for it. I picked it up in a sale a while ago because I thought it would be more convenient than using the discs I still have somewhere. That's not entirely true, but at least it's patched here.

If you're happy to go hunting online, you can find ways to make it run at 1920x1080, and switch the locale so cars drive on the other side of the road. (This is the USA localised version, but it seems to come with the data for the other versions, there's just no config screen to change it.)

Also, there's still an active mod scene at http://sc4devotion.com, but it would have been nice if they'd added workshop support, because who knows how long sites like that are going to stay around?" , 1 , 2 , 0.538977384567260742 , 0 , 0 , 2018-06-21 11:32:16 , 829
"I first played SimCity 4 in 2005 and instantly fell in love with it. Back then, I clocked in hundreds of hours of playtime and to this day it remains one of my favorite city builder of all time.

The graphics, although they may appear a little dated to modern eyes, still hold up quite well.

The most important aspect, the gameplay, is just as great as it was back in the day. You can create everything from a polluted industrial wasteland to a shining metropolitan utopia and everything in between. Although easy to learn, the game can be quite complex: you can manage everything from the topography to transportation routes in your city.

Although a minor point, it's worth mentioning that SimCity 4's soundtrack is superb. It definitely contributes to the game.

Additionally, there is still a somewhat active modding community for this game. There are mods that add new buildings, transportation options, custom textures, and various other things that improve the game overall.

One minor criticism I have is that a little work is required to get everything running properly on modern hardware, but there are a couple of guides available on the community hub for this. After tinkering with Steam's launch options for a few minutes, I had no further issues.

Overall, I recommend SimCity 4, especially if you like city builders. It is a classic and still one of the best examples of its genre." , 1 , 5 , 0.538676321506500244 , 0 , 0 , 2016-04-29 22:45:11 , 2813

"Sim City 4 is still the Gold Standard city building simulation game, 12 years and counting.  This game still is at the top of the throne because of all the customization and modification you're able to make in this game.  With several websites solely dedicated to hosting SC4 mods, you are left with endless possibilities in how you want to design your region and cities.  The only misfortune this game suffers from is that is doesn't have the modern luxuries of new games(enhanced graphics, better hardware support, better core features to name a few), but the modification to this game helps alleviate most of this issues.  

While my time on Sim City 4 is limited through Steam, I have certainly put in over 1500+ hours of game play throughout the years, and it remains one of my favorite games of all time(a game that I certainly keep coming back to over time).  If you're into city building games, this is a must for anyones gaming library.  Even after 12 years, every city building game that comes out has the same questions, which is, Can this topple SC4 for best city build sim?.  Each game has failed to dethrone this champion(Cities:Skylines might be the best bet).

Load times can be a bit long if you go mod crazy and given the age of the game it doesnt look amazingly shiny, but overall if you have that itch to be a mayor, then this will scratch it and more!  Even on todays machines, with a few tweaks - that anyone can do imo - this runs like a charm.

"Bought it and then refunded, the reason: Constant crashing after about 5-10 minutes of gameplay. I seen solutions for this fix. People on the community forums suggested that a person should download thirdparty modding and autosave features, so that when it crashes, you can pick up where you left off. 

While I thank modders and community for these suggestions, the games current state is no excuse, for lazy devs not putting any effort into this release, it's shame because I was somewhat interested in it's system; it seemed complex and fun, but the constant crashing had me start ALL over, and that's not a challenge, it's annoying and unfun." , 0 , 14 , 0.534159541130065918 , 6 , 13 , 2018-06-13 04:24:17 , 160
"If you can get this game to work like a dream, with no crashes and maintain framerate like I did, coupled with several hundred or more great mods from Simtropolis.com, this game becomes one of the greatest, if not the greatest city- builder money can buy. also, Can't forget that nostalgic ass music by the one and only Jerry Martin.

"The new age of SimCity has arrived in SimCity 4: Deluxe Edition. EA has created yet another fantastic game for the PC and they have succeeded in making it work. SimCity 4: Deluxe Edition is a marvel, because it's like you are building a real city on real terrain. You control the city in every way possible. I got this game because I am a SimCity fanatic and I couldn't wait to try it out. Once I finally installed the game I did the Tutorials (which are optional) and finally got to create an entire region! That's rite I said region, an entire state seems to be at your fingertips! You can make Oceans, lakes, rivers, mountains, cliffs, and even plateaus with GOD mode. Forests and animals alike can be created as well! In this game you are finally in control.

Graphics 9/10
Now I'm not one to judge a games graphics, because to me, that doesn't make a game what it is but this game is different. It looks as though you are in an airplane looking down on real forests and buildings that you yourself created, now that is what I call the work of EA.

Game Play 9/10
Now this is what makes SimCity what it is, you have control of everything on your map, the terrain, the animals, and obviously your city. You make your city from the ground up, you start with nothing but level land and then you make residential, commercial, and Industrial areas along with a power plant. You work your way up and begin adding schools, police and fire stations, library's, water plants, and so much more. Before you know it your small village where everybody knows everybody becomes a bustling metropolis, complete with towering sky scrapers and traffic problems, which brings me to my next topic. The expansion Rush Hour comes complete with the Deluxe Edition making it possible to drive cars, boats, and airplanes in your city. You can be a police officer chasing down a thief or you can be an evil scientist attempting to transport dangerous chemicals across your city. You can really be anyone and do anything in this game. There is also a mode in which you can move your sims into your city, where they can gather opinions from civilians that live in your city about how good of a job you are doing. In MAYOR mode you build your city and make complex road systems, airports, seaports and massive bridges to cross seas. You can design a sewer system or even create a vast country side of ranches and farms. The best part is in GOD mode, where you can unleash a hoard of disasters on your city, from fires too alien invasions you can re-create judgment day on your defenseless sims.

Replay Value 8/10
You can never finish the game but after a solid good 6 months of playing it you will feel like you have done everything there is to do, but in this game, the sky is the limit. If you had the energy and lived in a decent sized city you could recreate it rite on your computer, that is just how detailed this game really gets. This game gets more complicated the bigger your city gets and sometimes you get so confused that you just give up playing for awhile.

Do not rent this game, just don't buy it if you don't like simulation games. It goes for about forty dollars and it is a good buy so if you are really into the SimCity games you can mow a couple of lawns, but if you just like any good simulation game go ahead and buy it if you have forty bucks laying around.

Overall rating 9/10

"Best city sim ever created. Not without it's problems, dense cities become impossible to manage. If you're going for a city with a population of a million citizens you can do it but no matter how well you plan there will always be too much smog traffic and garbage. There will also be idiots who leave their houses deserted and start a life of crime in the thousands because their commute to work was three hundred miles away for absolutely no reason at all. Seriously if I put a commercial zone next to a house why do it's occupents commute to Holland?

Still, this is the best of the series and the series is the best in the world at city building. Simcity 2013 has exactly nothing that this doesn't have except a higher price tag and a deep feeling of regret." , 1 , 3 , 0.533035397529602051 , 0 , 0 , 2014-02-03 21:48:23 , 5344
"To my knowledge this was the last of the actual SimCity Simulator games, which in my mind makes it the best.  Yes it is an old game and the graphics will show that, but the game play is MUCH better than SimCity BuildIt which is a shadow of its former self.  One annoying thing is the driving quest feature just doesn't seem to work right with the newer operating systems, at least I have never got it to work right.  Anyway take this review with a grain of salt.  You will either like this old, yet original format of SimCity or you won't.

"For an older game SimCity4 is worth playing in my opinion.  I know a lot of people get frustrated with this game because it tends to lag a little once your cities get bigger but, I dont't think its the end of the world its still very playable. Within this series, I've played SimCity 2000('93) when my brother introduced me to it then I moved on to SimCity 4 and I've been hooked ever since. Another thing I've noticed about this game is that, you need a lot of patience and most people don't bother and they give up. The reality is SimCity 4 is very strategic because, you must think way ahead of time when laying out your city and think of future problems like traffic. I'd suggest taking your time and not try to rush growth of your city because, you'll run out of funds very early. It takes time to build a solid foundation so that you can have a decent mount of monthly income. Everyone who plays this game figure out what strategy works for them but, don't let the occasional frustration steer you away. Overall, I think this game is very fun to play and you can let you imagination go wild with the extra downloads you can add to your city." , 1 , 5 , 0.531697988510131836 , 1 , 0 , 2015-11-16 10:21:11 , 4729

"THIS GAME! MAKES ME SO ANGRY!

Not really the game itself, the game is legendary, this is by far the best city building simulater I have played, certain featured of Cities XL have made it a competitor, but does't get over the line against this game! There are a range of mods for this game to increase the functionality of roads, to expand on the limitations of the road snapping and limited interchange types etc. The only reason I get mad is since the game is old, it  has some performance issues on modern pc's when you have a larger city with more things for the CPU to load, it's simply not optimised for modern day machines.

I can't say I have played the new Sim City, alot of people have said it's not worth the time compared to this game, but I wish they made a re-mastered version of Simcity 4 like what they do for games like Age of Empires.

"The last good SimCity game before EA destroyed the franchise completely. This relic is a testament to how good the franchise used to be. I hope one day SimCity franchise is resurrected and competes with the likes of Cities Skylines. Now removing the nostalgia googles I must admit while I like this game there are some technical flaws with it, The one that I remember is the graphical glitches. I have no idea why it happens but as far as I am aware it only affects a few systems and it can be fixed. Despite the flaws I definitely recommend this.

"I haven't played the latest Sim City, but I've played all the rest. This is by far, my most favorite version. This gives you all the features that you expect out of a Sim city builder game. You zone land for the three basic types in your city: residential, commercial, and industrial. Each of the three zones has three subcategories. For example, you can pick an agricultural zone for industrial or medium density, which will allow small shops and factories. Same goes for the other core zones. Placement of services is critical in the city. Police stations, fire stations, and hospital proximity to things is all important. But your sims want more than just the essentials. They want soccer fields, plazas, playgrounds, and tennis courts as well. Again, where these units are placed is critical. Each thing you make costs a build amount and a monthly upkeep, so thought must go into it. As does how much road you have and of what type. You can eventually add rail, boats, planes, and a myriad of other additions to the pulse of the city. 

I have a few gripes with the game though (all minor). One, the camera controls could be smoother. Two, WASD should be the primary camera control instead of the arrow keys (the game shows its age here). And three, I wish the game had more organic choices for laying roads and placement of zones. All things snap to the grid and diaganol roads have a funny bend to them. These have nothing to do with the enjoyment of the game though.

"Oh, it's always the same with Sim City games. As you start a new game in a newly released successor, you subconsciously compare it to its predecessor. and the way you feel about it almost for sure is ok, they screwed up this, they messed up that.... 

At first you might feel a bit angry about that, but time cures all wounds - and sim city does it pretty fast! Because after only a few hours (which will feel like minutes, of course), you're absolutely into this spin-off of the well-known city-building simulator - developing grounds, constructing roads, planning to plant your gifted buildings or the top-notch skyscrapers of the world. As it is with RPGs in which you tend to say to yourself just one more dungeon, here it is just one more road, just one more building, just to the next 1,000 inhabitants.

I started a free game back in 2010 when I re-purchased the game via steam, and as of today, game time is still up and counting. I might take months off from time to time, but as sure as I'm taking breaks I am getting back to the game, continuing to expand my city.

Head over to Simtropolis or SC4Devotion and you'll find tens of THOUSANDS user created buildings, infrastructure, parks, roads, etc. 

At Minimum get the mod Network Addon Mod (NAM). It fixes how traffic is handled in this game as some of the limitations the game had before were way too restrictive and un-efficient. It also add A LOT of new road types and you can actually make some insanely cool highway networks.

"They say this (tied with SimCity 2000) is the best SimCity game ever made. And one can see why. SimCity 4 is filled with features and freedom that modern day renditions tend to lack. And despite being 10 years old, this is still THE game to play if you're looking for a SimCity experience.

And whilst yes, much of SimCity 4 has become outdated compared to recent City Builders; and it's somewhat behind in terms of the interface and streamlining of modern games; there are few games out today that offer the same feeling. The only game I can think of that comes close to this in terms of offering a balanced and enjoyable city building experience is Cities: Skylines, and that hasn't even been released yet.

So my verdict: A classic with gameplay that is still relevent.

"Easily one of the best traditional city-builders to date, along with Cities: Skylines. There's an enjoyable experience to be had all-round, from the regional gameplay allowing for metropolises of very large sizes, to the small details that appear upon closer inspection. SimCity 4 easily has the most in-depth simulation of your city's economy, which really allows you to see how your choices affect your city's growth. The art direction in SimCity 4 also adds to this, with each level of wealth and density receiving its own unique appearance, adding an extra layer of detail on top of the already impressive simulation. Every part of building your city is accompanied by a fantastic soundtrack, too, which will really make you want to continue building. The extensive modding community can add additional content on top of this already great game, too (although it isn't anywhere near as big as the Cities: Skylines modding scene).

SimCity 4 is not without its flaws, however. It's somewhat poorly optimised for modern systems, and this can become especially apparent with larger cities. It's harder to make your 'ideal' city in this game compared to Cities: Skylines, given that it gives you a larger picture rather than something where everything can be personalised. The traffic simulation compared to Cities: Skylines is also weaker, since the two games simulate the individual people living in your cities differently. Overall, the pros and cons of SimCity 4 boil down to what you want out of a city-builder." , 1 , 1 , 0.523809552192687988 , 0 , 0 , 2021-01-24 08:51:58 , 9703
"This game is so epicly good. Lots of fun in here. Game can run a bit poorly with a big city though as it doesn't really know how to utilise modern hardware (this game was released in 2003).

The game will also run on Linux through Proton, so there is no additional configuration needed for this game to work for Linux gaming.

Also, before you launch the game paste the following commands into the launch options, which you can find by right clicking the game in your library and, in the drop down menu, selecting Properties>General.

-CustomResolution:enabled -r1920x1080x32 -intro:off -CPUPriority:high -CPUCount:2

This will make the game run in 1080p (or whatever resolution your monitor is, so long as you type that resolution in place of 1080p. It will also skip over the intro logos for EA, making the game boot a bit faster and changing the CPU priority to high and assigning 2 CPU cores to the game will make the game run a bit faster too." , 1 , 1 , 0.523809552192687988 , 0 , 0 , 2020-12-31 18:38:20 , 381

"One of the best city builders of all time. The thing that seperates this city builder from every other is that the cities feel like their evolving it feels like theirs growth and when you see that growth you realize what a special game your playing.

My experience with the game is pre steam, and I still have the disk. Base gameplay is reasonably complex with a multitude of options, if some of the simulation is simplified becasuse of the technical limitations of its day. Has a dash of humor for good measure.

About the only other gripe I have about this game is not the fault of the game, but Steam. I wish this game had Achievements etc..  Steam really needs to give their older games Achievements.

"This is IT!
This game is the Holy grail of city simulation. You can search for other city sims, but there is none worthy of this one.
Sure you have the new ''city sims''. But those are games. Maybe they are playable, maybe they have good graphics, maybe they have a satisfactory sim engine. But nothing beats SC4. Nothing can even compare to the vastness of this beauty! The only reason I got a Steam account is to buy this game again. 
After you get a hang of it, you will be able to build vast cities. And I don't mean vast simcity 2013 stuffthatisntreallyevenbig, I mean real life vast. You can make a city over an infinite amount of tiles. and the tiles are 4x4km, so that is vast. You can make complex networks of roads, rails, waterways, highways, canals.. bassically anything you can think of. Due to the again VAST online community of modders, who after 10 years still make new and new stuff every day!
And when I say that, that means free and for the more organised teams thoroughly coded, tested and fully functional mods, that have changed the game to an extent, that it became unrecognasible. And all that from people that live for this game, not some employees of some big company doing stuff they are dictated to do as quick and buggy as possible.

"Simcity 4 was, and still is, the best city-planning simulator.

It have very deep game mechanics, which ensure the city simulation is dynamic. It is nearly impossible to just pan outmore zones without many different issues. Most of these issues will have  affect on the population, and this would cause other issues, etc. All the city planning simulators came after it failed to reach its level in terms of complexity. And it is friendly toward beginners. ( Hint: After go wild building for a while, you may want to go back to check the tutorials.) 
Its graphic is outdated.The game engine is not very effective. (One of the devs explained that is because the game was built before DirectX 9) The camera is fixed. Look at the screenshots and determine yourself. 
The game is moddable. The UI and the engine can not be edited. But all the data and the models are. This results in a great collection of building (and other thing on ground) mods. Most of them requires manual install, and sometimes need additional dependency. They can be found on Simtropolis or SC4devotion.com.
The most important mod for Simcity 4 is Network Addon Mod, or NAM. It is a great improvement, if not overhaul, of traffic system. I recommend anyone who plan spending more than 10 hours on this game to install it. Due to engine restrictions, build a tram-in-avenue/tram-on-road interchange or underground tunnel is more complex than it should.

I wish more features carried on in later Sim City games, although I miss some of the old features from Sim City 3000 - which was revamped for the DS - such as different disasters and the option to choose your city adviser.

EA should  stop selling it until they can make it actually runnable on a modern pc at its current state its little more then a scam product as far as i am concenred!

I had to run it in Win XP compatability mode and find a 3rd party launcher to get this thing running...
And it still crashes randomy without any kind of warning or indication that something actually went wrong...

EA has again proven that they are an incredibly unreliable company that does not care about its customers and is willing to pass of shit as a viable product.

this is a Nostalgia trap bordering on being a scam!

"Bought the game for nostalgia so it was very disapointing when the game did not work. The game crashes at least once an hour. When it isnt crashing, it is freezing forcing you to close the game and restart it. I have not been able to save once in the actual hour I tried to play. After the first hour of trying, the next few hours of play time were spent following fix guides and testing to see if those fixes worked (none of them worked, leading me to believe the game itself is bugged/broken). At this point, the game is unplayable. I never would have bought it if I knew how broken it was.

Edit: If you buy this game and it crashes, don't try to fix it. If you attempt to fix it it could alter your chances of getting a refund.

"This is one of the times I really lament the state of the Steam review system. It is difficult to give this game the rating it deserves based on a thumbs up and thumbs down alone. Skip the next two paragraphs for the TL;DR version.

The SimCity series used to be synonymous to the city simulator genre, kind of like Xerox and Kleenex are synonymous to photocopying and tissue paper respectively. This is an old game, so there will bound to be some minor issues running on relatively modern hardware, and back then, it was, at worst, tolerable, because nothing else came close. I had been playing this game even before Steam existed.

Then came the lackluster SimCity (2013) after years of waiting for its successor, and then a few years later, came the promising Cities: Skylines by a different company. This game was really good back then and aged gracefully way beyond any reasonable expectation largely thanks to its modding community, but ever since, I started playing Cities: Skylines two(?) years ago, I just never went back to SimCity 4.

In conclusion, any person new to the city simulator genre should probably skip SimCity 4 and go with Cities: Skylines instead. This game is really showing its age, modding it is a bit more involved, and the minor issues are still there. For anyone who is already into the genre but wants to have a more vintage experience or simply wants to go down memory lane, you cannot go wrong with this game. Given all that I have said, it is with an incredibly heavy heart that I no longer recommend this game for most." , 0 , 18 , 0.517797589302062988 , 2 , 0 , 2018-09-05 00:31:20 , 12264

No matter how long ive owned it or what other games I have, I still always end up reinstalling and pouring tons of hours into SimCity 4 over and over agian. This is really what Im looking for in a Sim game. The Sims is cool and all but no other Sim game brings me back like this one. The huge grid format with all the different spaces for different municipalities where the landscape, utilities, traffic, jobs, and everything all interweaves like a real nation would. I love Cities: Skylines for its new take on the old SimCity games but it doesnt have this one feature that changed everything for me. It wasnt just building a blank slate over and over anymore. The different cities would build and evolve differently and affect each other. Striking deals with each other for garbage, water, power, and all the other little ways each new city would play into the dynamic of the whole map. It was a great direction that seems to have been left aside. You do see that same spirit in how the different sims in towns would interact and intermingle with each other in the later The Sims titles but nothing along the sim city gameplay. What keeps bringing me back after all these years is how differently each play seems to evolve, so it doesnt go stale for me.

im not one to be put off by having to patch a game, but atleast for me, this is completely unplayable.

it starts when i launch in and its not in the correct resolution, and my resolution isnt in the settings. so i have to get a custom resolution, who cares, i have to with a lot of games. i do that and then as soon as i get in and load the tutorial it crashes, again and again and again. so i look up help.

i type in the CPU startup command. doesnt work. i get the custom launcher and toggle all the necessary setting with help of tutorials. doesnt work. i download the 4gb patch, finally works. but this time theres just no audio. i try all the settings, nothing works, i have a post on the subreddit currently to see if anyone knows any fixes.

it takes about 5-10 minutes to load into a new map on the smallest size. i have an intel i5. when i move the camera around the entire screen smears.

i search for help. they say that you need to change the render settings. i change the render settings and need to restart. i restart, wait another 10 fucking minutes to load into a world to find out the settings reverted back to hardware, despite me changing them manually to software. i do this a few more times before googling to find out theres a bug where fucking settings dont save.

so i finally solve that fucking issue and get the settings to stick and lo and behold, it doesnt fucking work, and that was the only suggestion given for that problem.

i got this for $2.50 and i still feel robbed. im sure the game is great, it looked great with all the videos ive seen. but i literally cannot play it.

this is in an ABHORRENT state." , 0 , 3 , 0.513305306434631348 , 0 , 0 , 2022-07-30 21:50:28 , 96
"Basically the standard to which any city builder is measured. The mechanics are initially obtuse but once you get the rhythm of city development going (Follow your RCI display steadily. Need housing? Build some and wait then the job demand will come. Constantly adjust your expenditures etc) the satisfaction of watching skyscrapers rise from your small village is incomparable. Each city zone becomes inter-connected and dependant as well, further feeding growth until you're rich enough to place landmarks like the Empire State Building or Pyramid of Giza.
For a game from 2003 it still looks fantastic as well, and the soundtrack has no right to be as well produced as it is. 
The only gripes come from someone that's reached the endgame of city development. The mod NAM is essential in fixing the quirks of population pathfinding, though it's a testament to the game's quality that it's still updated today. Agriculture will never provide sufficient jobs and isn't required to feed your civs so can be taxed into redundancy, the same with Dirty Industry which is essentially pointless. Constructions don't react well to inclines resulting in ugly jagged foundations, and without mods the boundaries between land and water are dodgy.
This is all nit-picking though. Sim City 4 has yet to be dethroned as the essential city builder." , 1 , 4 , 0.51314312219619751 , 0 , 0 , 2022-02-23 09:05:25 , 10044

"SimCity…The definitive city building game…The time show on steam doesn’t show the amount of time I have spent since I bought the game in 2004. As a matter of fact, I have gone through about 5 copies of this game…SimCity4 has infinite replay value. No 2 cities will be the same…..don’t even attempt to make a duplicate city…it will not work.Simcity4 works a little differently from the previous version of SimCity in that, where the previous versions just gave you a plot of land to build on, SC4 lets you select a region, akin to a city or county in your state. You can import and export among the regions, sell electricity, water and import garbage. Build a police station with a helipad and be a helicopter pilot stopping crimes. Build a hospital with a helipad, and deliver a liver for a transplant. Build a small airfield and  spray crops for insects, or write messages in the sky. Built an airport, and watch the tourism tax dollars start rolling in…" , 1 , 1 , 0.512195110321044922 , 0 , 2 , 2011-12-27 12:29:31 , 3954
"From Cities XL to Sim City: Societies, pretenders to the throne have come and gone, but none can truly challenge SimCity 4.

As the final franchise installment before the sale to EA, SC4 represents everything Maxis learned about the city-building genre they single-handedly created, quite appropriately, from nothing. It is meticulous without pedantry. It is involved without perplexity. It is engaging without gimmicks. Timeless graphics paired to a funky, soulful soundtrack bring it all to a mirror shine.

Sim City 4 is not just a shining example of wisdom distilled through generations; Sim City 4 is inspired requiem for a masterful developer.

"Why do I feel like this game slaps me silly for trying to build a city the way I want rather than their railroaded formula? What fun is it playing the same exact city over and over again? I want there to be a police station right off the bat... nope costs too much.... and the game literally tells you NOT to build a fire station until you have your first fire. By that logic, it makes sense build and raze them after each emergency.

The driving mini game is horrible. Cars vanish and appear while your driving making cars you were going to crash into vanish while the opening you did have is now magically occupied.

I have tried playing this game. I have forced myself to play it telling myself it'd get better but it hasn't. Honestly if I was offered my money back for it. I'd take it. The only reason why I bought this game was because I loved SimCity2000 as a child (which is no longer compatible with windows no matter how hard I try). I hoped to reclaim the joy of my childhood. Instead I listen to a bunch of sims all screaming about how badly I'm doing OR I finally get the balence right and make a meager $200.00 a month." , 0 , 11 , 0.512165307998657227 , 2 , 0 , 2015-01-11 17:03:16 , 546
"This game takes a bit of reading and youtube to learn, but, once you get the hang of it, it will bring you many hours of entertainment. Remember resources in other cities can transfer over, so you can make an entire city a landfill! I think that is really fun to do. Since you are god you can also ruin the lives of your citizens by setting fires, tornados, meteors, volcanos, aliens, giant robots, and more!

"A Classic that hasn't aged one bit. Like Civilization, the inner-victory of the game comes from one play-through of the game where one successfully implements his or her mental order onto the world of the Sims. I picked San Francisco because she is my favorite city. I began with a segment labeled 'Heart' where I built a Wind Power Plant, an Elementary School, a Clinic, a Farm and a Police Kiosk.  I grew the city from here as a core agrarian society, to the tune of the outer-hamlet. I picked low-density housing for my citizens because that felt good for everyone. There were experiments, for my citizens and myself: I destroyed the small fragments of higher density housing and industrial segments because they did not harmonize with the heart of the city. Jobs were available, and despite the recurring requests of my 'Law Enforcement Advisor', I deliberately made my enforcement coverage thin. Consequently, my fire defenses only required a thin coverage. After making my government profitable, I decided to built The Sphinx facing a beach, and hence looking west-wards towards the eternal enigma, for a community of Ocean-loving residents. The beat of the Hamlet started to change, and I built a seaport first. Then, a segment of heavy industries and a lighthouse. They became the immaculate clockwork giving the gold lustre to The Great Pyramid. The game crashed after I built an airport surrounded by culture and commerce. Boom, Bim, Draugvarsis... Life thrives.

"I feel like Simcity 4 deserves a lot of respect for how re-playable it really is. This game is ridiculously addicting and had a strong impact on city building games of its genre. 

Simcity 4 is a city building simulator that is targeted towards all audiences, unless managing business or cities isn't your thing, I haven't really met anyone out there that doesn't like city building. In this game, you must create a city by zoning Residential, Commercial and Industrial zones to increase your income through Tax paying. While you do this, you must also provide them with healthcare, education, safety (police & fire departments), utilities (such as power, water and Sanitation) and transport. Its a system that works really well with no particular end goal other than staying out of the bankruptcy zone and trying to get to commercial skyscrapers as best as possible. This game really opens your eyes to managing financial income as it is important you are spending on the right resources and making a profit while doing so. I think this is the main strength of simcity 4 in how it manages the way business is done and it works very dam well. This is why it is addicting as there is always something new to improve, something new to help give you more income and it will keep you coming back no matter what.

The first simcity game I played was 3000 and when I played it I was really young and didn't know what I was doing. For those who played 3000 and 3000 Unlimited/UK edition first, it is agreeable that 3000 was good before playing simcity 4. 3000 had some unique features but the issue with it is if you go back to it now, its difficult to manage things and mechanics aren't as good as they are in simcity 4. Its like the major difference between Hitman 2 silent Assassin and Hitman Contracts, these two games are good but Contracts substantially improved upon the gameplay.

I first played Simcity 4 Deluxe edition when I walked into a GAME shop one day when I was out with family at a shopping centre, I got it for £10 I think and when I got home, I played this game way too much. The box this game came in was very well detailed and the manual was perfect. I loved the game so much. After all those years, in 2018 I think it was I bought Simcity 4 deluxe edition on steam and its still dam timeless. I play this game to relax sometimes but other times I'll bang it out and try my best at it. Its just addicting like it was before.

The expansion rush hour introduced more mechanics to the game like the U-drive it mode which is incredibly unique as it turns simcity 4 into a GTA like game where you drive in your own cities. You can drive cars, helicopters and UFOS. If you get your hands on a tank, UFO or fighter jet in this game, you can go around destroying your cities. Its that good.

Simcity 4 also happens to have, in my opinion, the greatest soundtrack I've ever heard in a video game. Okami, Max Payne 3, Hitman Contracts, Fallout 1&2 are some games which have outstanding soundtracks but simcity 4 just has a remarkable soundtrack that I sometimes listen to casually. Jerry Martin and Co are just musical wizards who knew what they were doing when they composed this games soundtrack and it deserves wider recognition.

The sims 2, the best sims game in the series imo, had a bad soundtrack. To fix this, I use all of the music from SC4 in that game, it made the game's build buy and neighborhood music way better. Removing Jerry Martin as the main composer for The sims series was a really stupid decision. Also, if you have The sims 2, you can make your own Neighborhood terrains in simcity 4. Another great feature of Simcity 4.

Are there any issues with Simcity 4? yes. First off, you need the NAM mod to make the gameplay fair, if you don't have it, for some reason, citizens go jobless due to a messed up traffic system. NAM gets rid of this issues and improves the gameplay. 1920x1080 resolutions are not available unless you set launch options on steam and people have issues on windows 10 from what I have seen. I have windows 10 and haven't had any problems with simcity 4 whereas I had issues with The sims 2, another Maxis game.

Other than that, simcity 4 is still a legendary game everyone should play" , 1 , 2 , 0.507569670677185059 , 0 , 0 , 2019-01-04 07:02:40 , 2504
"Probably the best city building, management and simulator ever made. Extremely detailed, with lots and lots of well done prerendered graphics (the world, cars and some objects are 3D though, so it doesn't ruin the presentation at all). It's the deepest SimCity, and it's also the hardest: you'll really need to grow your city slowly and watch the taxes, or else you'll be bankrupt in no time. But if you're patient, you'll be rewarded with hours and hours of fun. It's good to be the Mayor!

There are some problems though. For example, no widescreen support and flawed transit (both can be fixed by mods). Also the game has some compatibility issues with newer systems and 64 bit Windows, so you'll have to use software mode and put some graphics options on medium and low.

Other small flaws are: the driving minigames (you can drive cars, helicopters, planes and even a tank on missions around the city), which are a bit annoying, and can become frustrating due to city traffic and sudden failures. Nowhere near as good as what Streets of SImCity did with SC2000's maps. And the other small problem is that  it tries to mimic the graphic style of The Sims, so most cities will look the same. Still, it's good that they didn't casualize the game to the max back then in 2003, trying to appeal to The Sims audience.

The terraforming is also pretty cool too, but most of the time the generated maps have beaches that are too inclined, so I cannot build a dock or anything like that without spending like over half an hour trying to figure out the perfect amount of terraforming to make it the right angle.

Simcity 4 is the best city builder around.


It has it all: a dedicated modding community, a ton of content (and a great DLC too), deep gameplay, and just pure awesomeness.

I find myself getting hooked into this game, with the massive regions to fill up with cities and then when I'm done, I get to look at it all in great detail.
The game offers a lot of content and gameplay with smallest of details. I love this game so much. If you want a great stragety base city builder, this is the way to go. 


Not even Cities: Skylines can manage to be this great in terms of detail and gameplay depth.



Well, if being the mayor of a city is your dream, well that dream has come true. Pick this game up when it goes on sale and you'll have a lot of fun.

But please note: This game is from 2003. Expect graphics bugs, optimization issues or anything along the lines of that. If you do experience problems with gameplay, remember to look online for solutions. Many people have posted solutions to this problem. Try them all before posting your negative review. If you give up on this game so easily by just giving a negative review and leaving it to rot without even trying a solution, you'll miss out on one of the best city builders ever made." , 1 , 2 , 0.504990041255950928 , 0 , 0 , 2016-03-19 09:12:52 , 1446
"There is a category of game that is underated by most of the gamers,   The city builder simulation...
How is it posiible to make fun by building and managing a city.   Playing a political character and try to get the most vote from the citizen.

Well, this game has a way to pull you into investing a lot of hours into building a city.

At the beginning, you will have only a restricted number of options.   You will build residential area, commercial and industrial.   After a while, you'll have to manage the education and the health departement.  You'll have to create a power grid and a water supply.

A new feature in SimCity 4 is the region map.  You will be able to create cities next to each others.  They are gonna be linked to each other in many ways.

First, they are gonna share the demand in residential, commercial and industrial zones.  
Seconly, you will be able to make deal between the cities (buying electricity, selling garbage, ...)
Finaly, when you'll become a master in creating a small town,  you'll be able to create large cities of residentials area connected to other cities that will be providing power, water, garbage disposal ...

There are a lot of MOD available on Internet and a lot of fan created content.

This game may be a little old but it's still the king of it's kind in my opinion.

"one of the pretty marvelous games that i've ever played!

great city builder game. so many good advantages in game design, even compare to tons of modern video games, including its successors.

but, pity that, the game is 32-bit, cannot run well on modern windows nt 6.x 64bit operation systems. after hours of playing, the city grows bigger and bigger, the game client would become pretty fragile, i mean, i mean it is so easy to crash. i almost cannot bear it. and saving game pretty frequently really breaks the fun feelings of the game.

so, i hope there would be some games which would have better gameplay depths than this game, and better game running stabilty, and better for 64bit era, but unfortunately, no one can be better than this game, i mean gameplay." , 1 , 1 , 0.504950463771820068 , 0 , 0 , 2017-07-31 10:30:46 , 2556
"Regarding inability to save.  I just tested this out and found that in God Mode I could not save but once I changed to Mayor Mode I was able to save.
Sim City 4 runs well even on modern systems; I am using an up to date version of Windows 10.  The GUI is easy to understand and the game includes easy means to check what types of zones are actually needed.  The one thing it lacks when compared to city builders like Caesar III, Caesar IV and Pharaoh is any kind of campaign game. As a city builder the game fulfills its function well." , 1 , 2 , 0.504801928997039795 , 0 , 0 , 2022-01-31 05:49:08 , 256
"     How does one go about writing a review for something like this? To some it feels like DLC for Simcity 3000, for others it's an amazing stand-alone title. So what about me, where do I stand? I reside in the latter category beliveing this is an amazing game on its own. But how amazing? Ladies, gentlemen, and others, my name is Mlobitz and welcome to this review. Today, Simcity 4. Let's jam! And yes I did just quote Arkada, DEAL WITH IT.

     When I was still 11 and browsing the Steam Summer Sale of 2013 (roughly a year ago) and a game caught my attention. You see, at the time I was obsessed with what I called them Retro Games and all the history they might hold. One of my favorite games from the NES/SNES era was Simcity. Rather simple but very rewarding and interesting, the original Simcity melted away countless hours of 5th Grade (when I was still 10). So when I saw Simcity 4 on Steam for $5.99 I hade to check it out. 

     Starting out, I had a hard time figuring out what to do, this is no simple game to learn. The in-game tutorials aren't very helpful except for teaching you the bare-basics of the game. I had to watch a large amount of YouTube videos to be remotely successful. Math is also required to make effective grids whether you use unit distace or cost to measure length of roads or avenues. To even get skyscapers in your city and make it look like a city, you need extensive knowledge and mastery of the game's concepts. One example of this was when my technology teacher let us play Simcity 4 on her computers every once in a while (she's an awesome teacher by the way), most of the students ended up skipping the tutorial and spamming disasters on barren terrain. One of my friends who played through the tutorials couldn't sustain a good income and generally didn't know what he was doing.  Accessibility gets a below average 4.2 out of 10.

     On to the good bits! When I finally got things up and running the game became challenging yet addicting and rewarding, I also felt proud when my city was filled with plenty of houses, shops and factories. The GUI can be hard to learn but once you get used to it it's efficient contains everyhting it needs to and more! It's cool when your perfectly laid-out grid is functioning perfectly while also being pretty.The journey to getting your city to this state is highly enjoyable and satisfying. One of the biggest things that makes this game so much fun to play is region gameplay. This lets you connect your cities and let them share resources such as power and water. This allows certain cities to provide certain things while being kept alive by other cities while keeping them alive. Maybe a city based around power getting water from a city based around water. Being as great as it is, gameplay gets a very good 8.6 out of 10.

     In terms of visuals there's not much to cover, for a 2D game in 2003 it's pretty standard fare. Although some 3D models like cars planes, and helicopters are a nice addition. zooming in reveals a lot of little details maxis has included like a giant spinning pizza at the pizza restaurant and clotheslines in houses' backyards. skyscrapers have and other large builings have little details like a pool near the top floor. Visuals gets a strong 7.8 out of 10.

     As for the music, I'm gonna come right out and say it, this my favorite video game soundtrack of all time. The music not only fits the game fantastically any track is amazing music to listen to while doing something like schoolwork or.... other schoolwork! Yeah.... Check out the whole soundtrack on YouTube, you owe it to yourself to do so. This soundtrack a masterpiece, so it gets a well deserved 10 out of 10.

     After finding the mean of all my scores, SImcity 4 recieves a respectable 7.65 out of 10.

"Edited from original.

 It's a simulator, the fun thing with simulators is you say when you have won or lost. It's something you have to look at a lot and maybe tweak and adjust or tear down and start again. I cannot express this enough, you set your goal in the region you want and work towards it.

 Or you find a region and see how it develops where you and the residents work together to make something you can both work with and look at for hours and hours. Because it did draw hours and hours trying to see how the game worked, where the balances where. And that was why we played them.

Sounds abit shouty, but its how I play and is this is valid to you. I do want you to enjoy this game as much i have as.

In a nutshell. It's an old game, I think you need to tweak win10, and maybe some resolution.
I play Mac, no issues with 10.10.3 on late 2008 macbook.
The rushhour is needed imho to see how commutes work.
Communities external to steam still there at Jan 2016.
Great to revisit and send a tornado through Bob Newbies back yard.. Bad arm was it Bob?

Part of the original.
If your rig can't run the all new fancy city builders, or you distrust the 'always on' DRM management style, this is great.

10/10 will laugh at children playing city management games again." , 1 , 1 , 0.504504501819610596 , 2 , 0 , 2015-03-16 12:14:04 , 1640
"Nice game, but it is really difficult to build a sky scrapers city or at least a city, i think its too complicated to be really funny for the common peoples, but if you read/watch some tutorials you can enjoy this game some hours as there are lots of possibility.

"I've played SimCity Creator and SimCity DS and thought they were pretty good. I've played those games in my childhood and I still play them on occasion for nostaliga. When I came across this ancient relic, I thought Wow, what an old game. It must be pretty shitty.
I thought indeed. 
After I played the tutorial, I learned that this is much better and more complex than the two SimCitys I have played in the past, and was very suprised to the capabilities it had. The other two had came out almost 6 years after this game had released and are very, and I mean VERY, more primative and basic than this game. About 1 1/2 hours later, I realized that the other two are absolute fucking horrible teir, and this one is god teir.
So, in my conclusion, I would give this an 7/10 so far. The last two have spoiled me with their easy gameplay and basic understandments. But, with more expirence and gametime with this improved game, I shall hopefully give it a higher score the next time I sit down and review this masterpiece." , 1 , 2 , 0.504373550415039063 , 1 , 0 , 2016-11-01 15:51:34 , 173
"This is the most elite example of Dumbed Down for the Console `Tards.  Simcity 3000 is better.  Simcity 2000 is better!.  By sacraficeing a massive amount of actual customizeability and gutting most of what makes SimCity fun to use, they make a game that is more appealing to causal gamers.  The terrain editor is a joke by not giving you precice control like the editor in Simcity 2000 and the way the zoning system adds in Streets Guts the actual customizeability and haveing 6 different roads that do the SAME THING is the most useless thing I've ever seen, they switched a pathetic power plant selection to have 10 different mass transit systems you will never NEED because the space they occupy traded by the paltry city size.  And why are there only two options for city size!? the Large city in this game feels smaller than the max city size in simcity 2000!

This is a Terrible game, do not waste your money on it." , 0 , 2 , 0.504315555095672607 , 0 , 2 , 2012-02-22 03:57:19 , 2292

"To begin with this includes ALL of the DLC packs for Simcity 4 - No need to spend much more!

Simcity is a city building game (Duh!) Made by EA and Maxis in 2003.
The Graphics are good for a game this old - In some places they look outdated (when you zoom in too far) 
The resolution scale for this game is Amazing since it was made in 2003 (I can reach the native resolution of my Screen (1280 x 800))

"Unfortunate addition to the Sim City Brand.


Graphically is identical to Sim City 3000, very pleasing for it's age!

Sound Engine is ideal though, I personally enjoyed Sim City 3000 OST way better. SC4 OST is less dynamic and mundane.

The UI feels over complicated with 'shortcuts' making navigation a chore and building suffers.

Overall this title was a displeasurable experience for me though not unplayable, you would be better off playing either Sim City (90s), Sim City 3000, or Sim City (2010s)" , 0 , 1 , 0.50397878885269165 , 3 , 0 , 2020-04-03 10:54:30 , 149

"SC Deluxe is the pinnacle of City-Builders to date, offering a complex city simulation and a steep learning curve unlike any other. The game tutorials introduce you to the core mechanics and an overview of how to balance your finances with your cities growth, and then allows you to develop the neighbouring cities into fledgling cities. Once you have accomplished this feat, the game offers various other famous locations to build your metropolises from scratch.

Although the game suffers dated graphics, the gameplay is definately not. My only suggestion is that if you do buy Simcity 4 Deluxe, ensure you visit the modding community, who have poured years into the various mods which not only increase city variation, but offer complete rewrites of various features (Such as NAM, a transport network mod which offers unprecedented levels of control of how your city traffic flows, and how it appears)" , 1 , 1 , 0.502824842929840088 , 0 , 0 , 2014-02-28 14:26:40 , 1955
"This game is very fun and enjoyable. Improving on the great Simcity 2000, everything is classic Simcity with improved graphcs. (looks 3D enough to be considered modern, though the resolution is not the best) I consider it the last game of the classic series. The newer Simcity games deviated from the classics a bit. 

In this game you play as the mayor of a city, building roads, power plants, police stations, schools to satisfy your citizens while maintaining a balanced budget. The schools and hospitals are similar to games of its genre. The transportation options are really detailed. You will have different types of roads, railways, ferry, bus and subway. You can also connect to neighboring cities, buying garbage capacity, water, and electricity. There is a little addition that allow you to control vehicles and complete missions on your streets. I consider it a small enhancement, not really important but sometimes giving you nice bonus cash to ease the game out a bit.

The only thing I am not able to recommend is the price. $20 for a game from 2003 is not justifiable. The game goes on sale for $5 during holidays. Would recommend buying it during sales." , 1 , 1 , 0.502712488174438477 , 0 , 3 , 2015-11-03 18:21:41 , 851
"[b][i]SimCity 4 – Deluxe Edition[/i][/b] is a city building and management simulator. Elected Mayor over a city-to-be or existing city, manage city development by laying roads, plotting land and zoning, constructing public service buildings and maintaining financial balance as you thrive to build a megalopolis.

[b]Pros[/b]: You are giving a lot of flexibility, from zoning density to street type. As your city grow, additional selection of power plants become available, and additional needs are requested such as water treatment facilities, trains and subways, ports and airports, as well as a variety of educational establishments, health and emergency services. You have a good list of additional tax options, each with their own downside and benefits. Keep a balance between how much financing you can afford, and how much you need, to give to each of your public services (as a whole or per individual buildings). More special buildings and landmarks become available as your population rises. You can even connect your different cities togetter with your streets, highways and railroads, if they are located on neighboring tiles on the map.

[b]Cons[/b]: You are limited to determining individual land plots and zoning type, with little control on what will actually be built. You may have small shops and fast food being build on high-density commercial areas you were planning to have towering office buildings on, or maybe cheap low-cost apartment blocks will appear on residential zones you wanted luxury condos in. City interconnection requires you to actually build the neighboring city, its streets not necessarily being aligned with each other's connections. Tax revenue is hard to come by, and you'll often catch yourself speeding up time and wait years to get enough money to continue building without resorting to high-interest loans. Public service coverage is radius-based, which forces you to finance overlapping territory, or leave out coverage in-between your schools, police stations and hospitals.

[b]Verdict[/b]: ★★★☆☆ - It's up to you

The amount of micro-management you have, plotting individual land plots, and the amount of effort it needs to reach actual high-density buildings, makes [i]SimCity 4 – Deluxe Edition[/i] more of a town simulator than a large urban sky-scrapper city simulator. Still, it remains a good example of the genre and the best game in its franchise.

Before EA lords screwed over the franchise. So much space to build and spread your cities. And the challenge of getting a functioning city is there, you will fail, and fail, until you magically manage to build a city that doesn't cause an economical crisis.

"What can I really say about this game. It's a alltime classic,but I do have a few complaints about what this version actually is.
This game is actually not optimized for Windows 7 at all. It's the same 2004 game slapped with a no-cd,that's all it is and all you will get. Make sure to save a lot,there were a lot of random crashes with the game too.
This is just sad that this game could've been more stable. Hell,there's not even 1080p resolution. You're stuck with 1600x900 if you don't use any mod. 
tl;dr : This game is great,but way too buggy as is. Save a lot. Would definitely recommand though

I do recommend this game probobly because its the only simcity on steam but also because of the types of cities you can build. i must say that my playtime may be low but that is because the mine had big visual bugs. if you dont know what i mean it was like red, green, and lots of black just smothered (<-- that even a word?) on the screen. so it was kinda tough to see what i was doing. so i tried reinstalling the game. (wich i am doing right now.) but anyways. i DO recommend this i shall say once again its just so much fun if you have a creative mind you should definetely play this game." , 1 , 1 , 0.502487540245056152 , 0 , 0 , 2015-09-03 23:30:30 , 3597

"You would not believe the hours I put into this timeless classic, I must of spent thousands of hours on this when I was young. SimCity 4 and Age of Mythology where the two games that got me into gaiming. I fcking LOVE this game!. The graphics are dated but what do you excpect from a game made in 2003. The game has endless replay-ability. From constructing mega cities to making small towns piled beneath 120 tons worth of nappies and crisp packets, this game is the best simcity out there. In my opinion.

The game has the ability to do contract work like flying a helicopter to writing swear words in the sky or chasing down a bank robber in a police car like robocop. I can't even begin to try to comprehend how they coded this as it baffles my mind. This game brings me back to the days where people waitied for games to come out and didn't just demand a broken game.

All the time when I played this game I had no idea the amount of mods that are out there. The modding community is one of the most active modding community I have seen since a Bethesda game. Theres no need for city limit extensions either the game comes with a massive border even for litte plots. What I always do is make cities into parts like East and West and they look awesome from the region view. You can edit the land, have military bases next to rocket launches and, and, and...
I could go on about this game for days on end it looks like I already have. So just buy it nomatter what price. £9.99 is still too little for this timeless classic.

"Do not buy this game if you do not know what you're doing with City or Civilization games. This is not The Sims, this is not just one family you have to build up and take care of, this is an entire city. Seriously, if you don't have a good hold on games like this, even when you play the tutorials, do not get this, you will be confused playing this. 
Otherwise, if you have a good hold on games like this, buy it. I know my hours are quite little, but I do play this offline a lot when I'm around a friends or when I'm on a long journey, not to mention the amount of hours I sunk into this game back in 2005 until 2010 when my copy disappeared.

My favorite of the series is still 3000, for a bit more simplistic game, and amazing jazzy music.  
This game gives you a ton of options.  There's almost too much to do, and a lot to forget to do until you get complaints about it.  
Very satisfying when it goes smoothly, and frustrating when you forget something, or miss something.

"Oddly enough this game works on my laptop, with the occasional crash. However I cannot recommend this game because of how glitchy and bugged the game is. Of course what did I expect from a game that was made in 2003, two years before I was born. If this game was remastered into a definitive edition like the Age of Empires Series is being done. It would be a cash cow for EA. However EA has not listened to their players since I don't know. EA has such greedy and rather stupid executives because they have no idea how much they are hurting themselves in the long run. Paradox Interactive the company that finished Sim City off is now probably about to kill off the Sims with their new Life by you game. I am excited for it however I am also sad because EA killed something that could have been grand. I could never recommend something made by EA they are a horrendous company.

"[h1] Introduction [/h1] SimCity 4 is still a solid choice for a game that came out 20 years ago, although it definitely runs like a 20 year old game. I can't recommend buying this if you're not interested in minor modding, to put it bluntly: It really needs mods to be stable. 

[h3] Gameplay [/h3] Once you load the game, immerse yourself in the classic intro cutscene [spoiler] (which you should sadly disable in launch settings due to stability problems) [/spoiler] you are greeted with the Region screen, likely looking over Timbuktu, the tutorial region, one of the six ready-made regions made up of square tiles of 3 sizes, 1 sq. km, 2 sq. km, and 4 sq. km. (while you're here you should totally [u]back up[/u] the regions before you use them) 

After perusing your regions, and finding a nice tile to work on you face the God mode, where you can use powerful terraforming tools to reshape the city tile. [i]Remember the [u]backups[/u] you made?[/i] SimCity 4 does not have multiple saves of a region/tile, so you must be fairly careful to backup everything once in a while. 

After terraforming the perfect city (or inhuman crags if you so desire) you can found the city by choosing a difficulty, picking a name for your Mayor and your City and then you're off to the simulator aspect.

[h3] The real Sim was the City we along the way [/h3] Once you found your city, the game really bears it's best aspects, and it's worst. One thing you'll likely have picked up if not when terraforming but once you begin building a city is that the game is based on a orthogonal grid of tiles, which restricts the shapes and road networks you can come up with heavily, even with mods.

 After this, if you decided not to pick the tutorial city with the giant waving arrow, you'll be bombarded with a really quite spectacular, yet complex web of systems, budget this, power that, water this, pollution there, traffic here, et. c. This is not a game you can pick up for 5 minutes and do well in, unless you play very cautiously you will likely bankrupt your city several times. Now, this is not a guide but I have nothing but praise for the depth of the city simulator in this game. 

[h3] Mods [/h3] Before you buy, as I mentioned eariler, you should REALLY, and I mean REALLY get some light bug-fixing mods, and one of the best mods for SC4, the Network Addon Mod. The NAM greatly improves the traffic simulator, allocates more ram to allow for this simulation upgrade, and increases the capacity of all transit networks to allow for a more realistic city building experience. The mod also includes a ton of (optional) puzzle pieces for building much more complex transit systems. In addendum to these great community patches, there's a bustling modding community that consistently churns out all kinds of bug fixes, reworks, ploppable buildings, building types and more.

[h3] Summary [/h3] Still my favorite citybuilder in 2023, and many could say the same. If you're here because you're a city nerd, or owned it in the past I'd certainly buy it on sale even if you like playing other options like Cities: Skylines. It's truly remarkable how this gem holds up and has a dedicated modding scene so long after it's release, and abandonment by EA." , 1 , 1 , 0.497942358255386353 , 0 , 1 , 2019-11-10 11:15:55 , 17436

Some memories are best left behind. Unlike some other games that resurface with updated graphics and other features to bring them to the modern world, this version is still living back in 2000 or whenever it was. Graphic options are very limited, so if you're playing on a nice little wide screen monitor these days, well, this kind of sucks. Actually, most everything about this game graphically sucks now. Back ~20 years ago, this was great stuff. In 2020, well...

Other than the graphics, the game is like you'd expect from the old days. It plays the same and reminds me of why I liked it so much.

Much recommended, regardless of its age, possibly the only city simulator ever truly worth it.

EDIT: Further study revealed that the issue with crashing or sudden abortions of the game was and remains to be mainly use of multi core CPUs, not so much of the make itself. Therefore it's advisable to set the SC4's CPU affinity to single core only which significantly reduces the infamous occurences of game aborting to desktop in a zap. Still, keep saving the game progress frequently, especially before and after all major building or city tweaking sessions.

"I played endless hours of this game as a kid and nothing has really come close to it, especially with the NAM mod. However, these days it is impossible to get it to work on most computers. As we get farther from 2003, the number of tricks you have to employ has grown. I've tried everything and finally gave up getting it to work on my machine. I got to the point where it would display the region, but clicking to start a new city would crash it. This is after getting the 4gb patch and configuring all the launch parameters. Even those that get the game to work report a ton of crashes during game play. Just shows how much this game was loved that people try so hard to keep playing it, but at this point it's too much work for a game!" , 0 , 1 , 0.492040544748306274 , 0 , 0 , 2023-03-23 00:23:16 , 21
"It's now 2014 and this is still the best city building game out there. Sure the graphics are outdated but every other aspect of the game is superior to more modern titles. Despite being old, the graphics are still pretty decent (actually supports HD widescreen, just google it) and you'll find yourself sometimes zooming in to buildings just to admire the details. Although the game is simple to pick up, its deceptively difficult. It takes practice and planning to grow your towns into cities into bustling metropolitans. The mechanics are complex and challenging but also very rewarding to master. I have logged hundreds of hours on this game over the years creating vast multi-city regions.

Once you think you've covered all of the game, finally grew some elusive skyscrapers (or whatever your goal is), there is still a plethora of mods available to you. Whether you want real life buildings, fantasy buildings, custom regions (some created using real life data), or advanced networking/traffic capabilities, there is something for everyone. This game is now 10+ years old and there is still custom content being created on nearly a daily basis. What other game has this much longevity?

"What's with this game? You start off with a hefty sum, you lay out your city, and you're on your way. Later on, people start complaining about lack of fire coverage, or there's a crime spree in the city, or the health and education aren't up to code. And you try to convince them that it's NOT IN THE BUDGET! SURPRISE! A fire breaks out in the city and you're forced into buying a fire station. I really wish how tax per-capita works in this game, because every time I put a school down, it's like 250 a month. Put a large medical clinic in, it's around 500. And it has to scale with the population with your city or the masses will strike.

"Playing SimCity is a lot of fun, but how did they miss the mark so badly on the technicals? 
-There's no Undo button, so if your building doesn't place right you need to spend the money to essentially rebuild it. That can be rough if youre on a budget. 
-There's no manual rotate or placement key which can be frustrating when you're trying to orientate a zone or building correctly
-Next there's no auto-save, which wouldn't be huge if it wasn't for the next problem 
-THE GAME FREQUENTLY CRASHES. So you need to go back and redo the 20 minutes or hour worth of whatever you were doing. VERY frustrating. 
-The soundtrack allows you to edit the playlist, but it doesn't tell you the name of the track you're listening to. 
-Popups will pause the game, but when you're through reading them it will revert to the speed you were running, which can be problematic if there's something time-sensitive and it goes back to high-speed. 

Also there's a shoe-horned in minigame where you drive around your city in a little car which is cute for a minute, but then it becomes tedious and annoying. Like a feature that was poorly thought out and tacked on at the last minute. Sheesh as I'm writing this review, I'm more and more shocked that this is hardly the first SimCity in the series, but it's like they didn't playtest it at all. I got this because I had the itch to play SimCity and this was the cheapest and easiest path. Now I feel like the $20 pricetag should be more like $5 or $10. It's a pretty flawed game.

Update: The crash rate is making this game unplayable. Such a shame" , 0 , 6 , 0.490752220153808594 , 0 , 2 , 2022-05-14 23:07:14 , 244

"I played all the SimCity games from the very beginning, and SimCity 4 was a crowning achievement in the series. Sadly, however, it's just too old now. If it weren't for the folks at Simtropolis, it wouldn't have lasted as long as it did. It had a great modding community that pushed it well past its expiration. If you got SimCity 4 back in the day, then you lucked out. However, if you're new to this genre, or this game specifically, then look elsewhere.

Unless it's on sale, or you have a computer with specs and hardware from the time frame this game came out, then don't bother. Also, for me personally, SimCity died long ago, when Maxis was purchased by EA, and we all know how there's not enough time for that story.

If you want a better city simulator, check out Cities: Skylines.

"- On my machine after installing (windows 11) text input fields were not functioning at all. (Can't name city)
- There's no option to invert mouse scroll or change interface controls. They're a little bit clunky.
- The number of gameplay settings that can be adjusted appears to be 5. There's some graphics settings.
- Overall the interface feels clumsy 
- A top down view might give a bit better oversight.

The actual content of the game might be alright, but I didn't quite get that far. The interface was a bit uncomfortable. Overall, I think it feels like a clumsily done city management game. You kind of have a certain set of things you're probably expecting to do, and there's a take on most of those things in the game. But the way things are done is just kind of not there. My first impression was that after starting the game, the text input fields didn't work. It was not possible to write the name of the city. Then I tried to create the city, and the mouse look system was hold right mouse button and drag, but I'm used to the inverted version of that, and it's not possible to toggle inverted scroll for that. That's just a basic thing that has done been done in a thousand games, and there's usually an option in the settings to toggle that on or off. So when I looked into the settings, there was 5 items you could change. That seemed unusual. I think it's probably that the core game is fine, but the interface is not.

"SimCity 4 was lots of fun back in the day, but reality is that the game didn't age well.

When compared to Cities Skylines, this game has better mechanics, despite its bugs.
Sound track is better in my opinion and budget management style is more direct to the point and intuitive.

Building the city's road network system is another story.
I don't consider neither this or CS good in this side.
Both games have mods to help you, but it's quite a nightmare to get something done right.
Simtropolis is the main mod page for SimCity 4, and you can get Network Addon Mod to give a try.

In terms of graphics, this game already shows its age, but the biggest issue is the game UI, which can't be upscaled.
You can run this game with Widescreen Resolution and SweetFX, however the UI will get smaller, as the resolution gets higher.

My best recommendation, if you are running it in a 1080p monitor is to use the following launch parameters for the game:
-CustomResolution:enabled -r1600x900x32 -f -d:opengl -intro:off -CPUCount:1 -CPUPriority:high

Then add SweetFX to improve image quality by dropping the contents of the zip file below in your ...\SimCity 4 Deluxe\Apps folder:
https://mega.nz/file/s4cizA5T#xjHtxjvEfP9OpRskXiDsR6jN6ekQ-GFBwnFv6RbZdjY

If you want to edit SweetFX parameters, open the SweetFX_Settings.txt file inside the ...\SimCity 4 Deluxe\Apps\SweetFX folder and change parameters to your liking.

Note: I've written a more detailed guide for this:
https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3258173631

Moving forward... in the past I've considered the cash grab POS called Cities Skylines, with mods offcouse, as the best alternative to SimCity 4.
Reality is that I've tried again both games now in 2024, and found them both to be unplayable, each due to its own issues.

Maybe I'm getting older, maybe CitySim games are not what they used to be.

"Steam Sucks.
This game will not load and the best part is that they admit that they don't have access to some sort of code from the manufacturer of the product. I have to get in touch with support and go through hops to just play this game.  
I bought it back in November I know and it didn't work then either. Life got in the way and I simply forgot.
Beware people, these people who run steam don't give a damn about us people. They got my 20 bucks, oh well. I will now uninstall steam and never ever come back the these rip-off artists.

"SimCity 4 Deluxe is a classic city-building simulation game that, unfortunately, falls short in many ways. Despite its pedigree, the game suffers from a range of issues that make it frustrating and unenjoyable to play.

One of the most significant problems with the game is its steep learning curve. The game's mechanics are complex and unintuitive, making it difficult to understand how to build and manage a successful city. Even after hours of gameplay, it can be challenging to get a handle on the game's many systems and mechanics.

The game's graphics and performance are also lackluster, even for a game that was released over 15 years ago. The graphics are dated, with low-resolution textures and blocky models that fail to create an immersive city-building experience. The game's performance is also subpar, with long loading times and frequent crashes and freezes.

Another issue with the game is its lack of depth and variety. Despite the game's many systems and mechanics, there is a noticeable lack of content that makes the game feel repetitive and dull after a few hours of playtime. There are only a limited number of building types and options, making it difficult to create a unique and varied city.

Finally, the game's AI is poorly implemented, with the simulation failing to provide a realistic and engaging experience. The AI is unpredictable, often making bizarre decisions that make no sense and can lead to frustrating gameplay.

Overall, SimCity 4 Deluxe is a disappointing entry in the city-building simulation genre, with a steep learning curve, lackluster graphics and performance, a lack of depth and variety, and poorly implemented AI. While the game may have been groundbreaking when it was released over 15 years ago, it has not aged well and is not worth the investment for modern players." , 0 , 3 , 0.478527635335922241 , 4 , 0 , 2023-03-14 16:03:22 , 969

"In the 5 hours I've played so far across 6-8 sessions, I have not manually closed this game myself. It WILL crash to desktop. Usually between 40 minutes and 1.5 hours of gameplay. With no autosave, this is frankly unacceptable. The game is fun, and I only got it for 3 dollars, but it simply is not worth your time as it will waste your time. Twice I have built cities of 20,000 residents, only for the game to crash, and the area on the map to be untouched when I return." , 0 , 0 , 0.47826087474822998 , 0 , 0 , 2023-05-29 12:15:13 , 283

"The gameplay is fun. This really was the best City-Builder of all time. Hands down. Yes, it's dated, but graphics aren't everything and there's a certain charm to its archaic appearance. 

HOWEVER: 
The game constantly crashes and doesn't auto-save. You lose countless hours of work this way if you don't manually save often. Unfortunately, I don't think the game is compatible with modern hardware. I don't think I've ever played once without crashing. My love for the game makes me push on, but I don't think I can take anymore punishment. I hate to say it, but don't buy this game anymore.

"So this game has been the light of my life ever since 7. This is truly a timeless masterpiece. It's well crafted with a few graphical glitches here and there but its nothing to worry about. The main thing I bug about is the lag sometimes, no rain, and really not much of realism like cars disappearing or people disappearing stuff like that and once you zoom in on some crime going on it immediately disappears. Maxis, if you are still around, please update the damn game. It COULD use a few new buildings, not mods, but hey just update it please." , 1 , 1 , 0.47826087474822998 , 0 , 2 , 2020-08-07 16:40:10 , 3183

"While SimCity4 was a great extension of the series i felt it lacked whatever it was that made 2000 so great.  Having said that it was and still is a great game that you may want to check out if you never got the chance, especially if its on sale.  Connect your cities and watch them prosper or fail.  Doom your citizens to death by fire, alien robot invasions and tornados, earthquakes, etc, etc. or let them live long healthy lives and keep track of them everywhere they go like a creepy 1984 big brother.

"[b]Mayor Rocks According to City Blocks[/b]

SimCity 4 Deluxe is a classic city-builder game that offers players the chance to build and manage their own metropolis. SimCity 4 has the best interactive UI of any city builder I've seen, though I might be blinded by nostalgia. The game features memorable city advisors, each with their own unique personality and expertise, which offer valuable advice to players and help guide them through the complex task of running a city. Additionally, the game's fitting soundtrack adds to the overall immersive experience.

However, one major flaw in the game is the development desire system, which can be frustrating and economically damaging to a city. The unintuitive zoning demands can lead to a city's development being stunted or even reversed, which can be a frustrating experience for players who aren't familiar with SimCity-type city builders which rely on the player somewhat gaming the system to incite rapid growth.

Despite its issues, SimCity 4 Deluxe is still a great game to me that has offered a lot of nostalgia-driven enjoyment. Its classic graphics and the manual drive missions provide a unique gameplay experience that I haven't seen replicated in any other city builder to date, and the memorable advisors add a lot of personality to the game. SC4D is a solid choice for anyone looking for a classic city-building game, especially for older hardware that won't play nice with the newer titles. The game still goes on sale semi-frequently for massive amounts, and I'd recommend picking it up then." , 1 , 0 , 0.476190477609634399 , 0 , 0 , 2023-04-22 21:52:24 , 8374

"First off, I'll admit that my review is a bit slanted by personal  opinion. Sim City is not a bad game, it simply lacks what I find most interesting and fun in a city builder. It simply Shows its age too much when compared to games like Cities in Motion or City Skylines. Also, when  I played this game, I found the tutorial almost useless. I never really got the hang of the game and quickly lost interest.  I kept it with the intention of getting a friend who plays and enjoys the game, but found they had moved on to those other City builders I mentioned above.
I can understand others who figure out the ins and out of this game getting more enjoyment that I did and I also fully acknowledge that City Skylines and Cities in Motion likely would not exist today were it not for Sim City. Finally, while I found the game lacking for myself, I do not feel that I overpaid for the game. There's a lot there.

Though I have to say the latter is still pretty enjoyable nonetheless, especially because of the great amount of detail it has, it, in my mind, simply cannot compete with the sheer scale that Simcity 4 offers, which to my tastes is still the OG of citybuilders as you've read.

"The SimCity series is well known as a city and urban planning simulator and this iteration  is no different.

"Still my favourite city builder as of 2020, if not by much.

The modding is by far the biggest advantage. There's both tons of existing content and plenty of ways to modify the game to one's own liking.

And while Skylines has that too, what keeps me coming back to this game more often is how easy and rewarding it is to jump in and start building. It loads almost immediately and growth is fast and visually impressive. So I keep coming back to try out new strategies and layouts.

There's also the fact that this game has the second best soundtrack ever, after SimCity 3000.

The game's main downside is the notorious infinite commuter bug, which severely hampers regional play - one of the core features of the game and what would have been its main draw otherwise.

The other major disadvantage is the lack of resources beyond power/water/garbage. All industry is essentially generic and always exports. Nobody consumes anything and there are no imports or internal freight traffic. This aspect is what makes Cities XL one of my other contenders for favourite city builder." , 1 , 0 , 0.474126070737838745 , 0 , 0 , 2020-03-21 17:12:33 , 5658

"Running low on funds to run your city?  You can do missions for the good guys or the bad guys and everything will be fine...or will it?   Go from building the city to playing one of the citizens real quick and back again.  But don't mess up too often or it could bankrupt the whole town.

Has some bugs and is real old tech.  Still it is lots of fun.

Simcity online should have been more like this game.

Oh and another thing....the theme music for this game is Legendary.....boom boom boom boom, boom boom boom boom....etc....this music makes everyone instantly cooler just for listening.

Oh and one more thing....you can actually connect your cities with actual roads and they benefit from the traffic and....well you gotta see it for yourself....the more cities you play the more your cities benefit.   Your new cities will start with any roads from adjacent cities that you've already created/played.  Try to find that in one of the newer city building games.

"I got this during Steam Summer Sale 2017. Like many of the people who play, I had SimCity 4 Deluxe Edition on CD. I spent about probably 8000+ hours since I started as an 8 year old. Ah, back when I couldn't find the damn registration code but a friend of mine always lent me his. Good times. I got this game after a certain update in either Windows 7 or 8 disallowed something that SimCity 4 on CD requires to play. Since this is entirely different from the CD version, it works tremendously well.

If you're into graphics and all that for simulation games, you might as well throw that view out the window. For a game that was released nearly 14 years ago, this was at the top of its game and honestly, it still is. The gameplay is fun as hell, with the tank being the most strongest vehicle (until you crash into 100 tanks and log trucks). I prefer this more than the new SimCity that came out 4 years ago(?) any time.

How you play SimCity 4 is really up to you, though. You could either play with the standard and already implemented buildings, or you could go to Simtropolis and download mods for SimCity to make yours look more realistic. There is nothing wrong with playing with either, however, one disadvantage about playing with custom mods: The more you have, the longer it takes to load a region, and in a related topic...

Depending on your computer, you may crash numerous times. The game does take a lot of demand on the computer, but again, this varies. Sometimes you'll still be running the game, even if you have already quit. I do suggest reading the compatibility stats for your computer and the game.

Overall, still a great game and a lot of nostalgia value for me. Give this game a try!" , 1 , 3 , 0.47306397557258606 , 1 , 0 , 2017-08-05 21:49:56 , 2049

"I love Sim City 4 the best Sim City Ever.  That being said I bought it on steam for less than $5.00 dollars and it crashes 2 to 3 min into the game.  I searched steam and the internet for a soultion and have tried 3 different fixes which have not fixed the problem.

I got it cheap and it is an old game so it's not a huge financial loss.  It's just a loveable game.  But with the crashes and no solution that I can find lt's unplayable.

Its just let down massively by the fact that even now it crashes, incredibly often, just as you're starting to really get into laying a city out.

"this game series I was told was the cream of the crop for city builder sims, I found the game very infuriating to play. had to spend more time shifting through menu and menu. no way to track common issues and expenses without have to switch between up to 6 different menus to see individual stats for buildings would have like to track thing in a more streamlined fashion for general ease of control. custom regions option is  not even well thought out as you have to edit each tile individually to create a map. speed up function was pointless as as soon as there was a crisis it would pause the game, as soon as you closed the pop up would speed through 2 more months before you could fix the issue causing drastic drop in mayor rating. felt like game was build to be played in 1x speed to promote longer play times. game felt over bad compared to its 2000 counterpart which feels like a much better game which is sad.

"I had a positive review of this game but I changed my mind.

-There's hardly any QoL mechanics we're used to now.

-I HATE how 1 small ditzy fire pauses the entire game.

-If your city goes without power for a few days on accident your entire population will disappear like they were never there and it takes forever to rebuild it (I mean when your power cuts out in your city it sucks but you don't see 75% of the population leaving within 30 minutes of the power being out, calling it quits).

-City growth can be confusing as hell sometimes and makes no sense.

-Zoning can be a PITA as you have to fight and juggle which direction it faces.

-You need to have those annoying popups on and when you have a big city they pop up every 30 seconds to minute, if you have them off you can lose half of your city to something stupid.

-Crashes sometimes.

It is also unclear  if neigboring cities can interact...eg if unemployment in one city is high and you build a neighboring city with many available jobs and link them with rail highway roads or ferrys why there wouldn;t be a positive impact on the unemplyment.

"Unintuitive, clunky, poor interface, boring, lack of personality, just plain not fun. Any one of these things would spell the death knoll for a game, but SimCity nails them all. To make matters even worse, it doesn't like windows 7 or 8, and will fight you to the death on anything past XP. And it will win.

See, the sad part here is I actually *LIKE* city-builder games. Tycoon series? Pretty good! Tropico 4? Awesome! SimCity 1? Win. Afterlife? Epix Win. Sim City 4? Eh... mediocre at best?

So what went wrong? How did SC4 fail it up so badly?

I think the biggest problem was they lost sight of what made sim city games fun... the city building and the balancing of economy against people's desires. These things all exist in Sim City, and they've been inflated to a status of excessive grandeur, but that may be where the problem is: too much of a good thing.

Yes, there's lots of buildings, tons of them in fact... but it mostly just turns into a bogged down mess of junk to sort through if you want to have even a minimally running city at all. Instead of having a reasonable juggling act of a few major things your people need to be happy, tempered by a limited economy, Sim City 4 just throws all caution to the wind and piles on heaps of useless busywork. It's not even interesting construction; a good chunk of it's underground where you'll never even see it anyway. It's just there to waste money and make building the city more realistic but less interesting.

If I wanted real I wouldn't be playing a game.

Tropico 4... is a nice balance. It tosses the balls at you one at a time, slowly ramping up the difficulty and keeping the game entertaining and interesting the whole way. Sim City 4 piles too much needless crap on all at once that provides a remarkably harsh learning curve, for a minimal reward at the end.

Sim games have typically struck a wonderful balance in the past between the work and reward aspects, and gave you the tools needed to quickly and efficiently manage your little slice of heaven (or both heaven and hell if playing afterlife =P ). SC4 just kinda drops the ball (to maintain the juggling metaphor from the previous paragraph) by giving slow, irritating, clunky tools which technically get the job done, but are a pain to use and not very fun.

Toss in the severe glitches, and absolute, seething hatred SC4 has for pretty much anything above WinXP, and you may as well not even bother considering it. There's simply better games out there... Cities XL for the obsessive compulsive realistic city builder, Tropico 4 for those who want a great storyline and awesome gameplay with proper balance of being just right a la goldilocks... and afterlife or sim city classic if you're nostalgic.



Final Verdict:

SC4 really just doesn't have a place in the city builder market. Anything it does, other games do better. Much, much better. Game-breaking glitches don't help it's argument, either.


Overall Score: About 40%. If you can get it to run, it's not really BAD... it's just not particularly good, and you can do better for lower cost, anyway. The music's pretty epic, though." , 0 , 25 , 0.469499558210372925 , 0 , 1 , 2013-11-27 08:09:54 , 289

In 2023, the soundtrack curates play perfectly, the visuals a time-capsule of perspective of the magic of the early 00's, seeing what was considered modern and high end at the time with the architecture style choices shows how grounded culture was before the contemporary insanity of the woke 2020's.

"This game is not worth 20 dollars.  Lucky for me they had a sale and I got it for ten.  And sense I see the updates it seems to have a bunch of sales.  So try and get it when they are having a sale.  This game is pretty fun.  You can build a city as said and you can destroy it with a disaster.  There is one major thing though (before I say anything my computer broke and the game got deleted from my computer when i got steam back so they may have fixed it but probably not.)  the textures glitch out and there is a huge green line that suddenly appears in the screen.

Whenever you start to build a new town, you have no bounds how to do it. I love watching my town getting bigger and bigger, see how it is slowly evolving. You can do whatver you want, do as you want and whenever you want. 

Unfortunatelly playing this game on nowaday machines is pain in ass.. Game is crashing, frame rate issues, no nowaday resolutions support and other glitch appearing on Windows 7 or Windows 8/8.1 is just ruining the experience. There is no official patch to fix and or optimize the game on today's computers. The game's requirements is 10 years old and I know non of the people who can run this game with no issues. 

This game is probably a king of all cities simulations, but hardware issues is just dissappointing.

"Holy crap this is ancient. It seems to be a good game for it's time. I remember Simcity 2000 and 3000 with nostalgia goggles on. This one has an elaborate multi-city system, which seems like it would have been a good idea. There was love and care poured into it for sure. I liked that I quickly discovered you can custom make a few sims and move them into the city. 

However, I simply cannot get past it's age. No scroll speed adjustment, no 16:9 resolutions, no diagonal scrolling, no viewing the stats of buildings or adjusting them when you click on them, etc. I cant even tell what the symbols over abandoned buildings mean half the time. I only played for about 10 minutes, but it was long enough to know that I've moved out of the stone age and discovered fire and the wheel since it was made. I won't be getting a refund, as I bought it on sale, but I'll likely never open it again.

TLDR: If you can handle bad controls and a not-so-intuitive design, this game might be awesome. Otherwise I would say purchase something newer. Cities Skylines is okay if you can deal with the brain-dead traffic AI, and Simcity 2013 is good if you can tolerate the bugs and don't mind never using megatowers.

"After a 20 year break, I figured this summer it would be a good time to get back into the SimCIty franchise with 2003's SimCity 4.

This is one of those games where its greatest strength happens to also be its greatest weakness. The game is incredibly deep, which to a SimCity enthusiast must be the ultimate dream. For entry level players it is however a substantial barrier to entry. There is a tutorial, although I felt it could have been a little more in depth beyond the basics it does go over.

But once you are rolling, you are in command of all the tools you'll ever need to run your city. If you're like me, you'll become attached to your city as its very own life-form, and will want to nurture it along in its development. 

And since this is an 8 year old title, it was a nice surprise to have a game today that isn't innundated with achievements and ceaseless updates.

"One of the best games I've ever played, so much fun.

Btw. some people tell you you have to mod it like shity skylines to make it playable and fun but to be honest all you need are two more hospitals and you are good to go. Also since you have the deluce version which has the rushhour addoon in it you can play it with smaller cpus if I remember correctly. Because the original version if you had a lack of cpu power it would let the whole trafic flow over one route which is just anoying. But who still has such a smal cpu? Also you should write special start conditions in the header of this file, just google it and you know what I mean, to play it in HD. You can also play it in 4K but except that the menus are rediclius smal your pc will not make it. Seriously everything is rendered with the CPU, it is an old game. You need a 500€ cpu and you might be able to do that.

Anyway let's cut the bullshit I could rant over so much about this game the whole time but seriously just play this game if you look for a serious chalange. Actually you can outmaneuver the game and just make a big city without anything but hightech industry, no smoke yeaaah!.^^ But if you want it more easy play shity skylinies or shities xxl.
If you are not familier with the simcity serious I am telling you play 3000 first, but where to get it, and where is an installer for modern PCs? I was able to install it back with win7 but win10 doesn't work and it has allot of problem which is sad because simcity 3000 is one of the cutest and funniest city builder which you still can consider serious.
So play simcity 2000 instead and when you are back and just outplayed this game (*cough* just crank the taxes up to 8 *cough*) and than come back and play this one, it can be tough as nails but after a 100 hours you have a natural flow and just do it without thinking about it. Yeah I gues I am one of the few ones who may plaed 1000hours of this game but that was way back in the 00th years. But I can guarantee you 100 hours of fun.

"A all-time classic in my world and ten years later, still utterly playable.  Recommended to all those with cravings to literally make a perfect world for us all to live.  It's odd though, no matter what I 'tweak' this game runs choppy and seems only fit for CPU's under 2 cores and older school graphic cards (Nvidia 7 series and older), but still works OK-ish.

Somehow for me, it works better in software mode (which means my Gfx card isn't used at all) but doesn't look 100%, but a lot more playable.  I guess a single core on my 8 core system works better than a my Gfx cards GPU's and cores.

Why have suddenly started playing this again?  SimCity, the (2012) new release has officially been annouced by Maxis and EA... finally after ten years, it's getting it much deserve update.

"I grabbed this game hoping to relive my days from playing SimCity 2000. It's total garbage. No matter what strategies I tried, my cities all failed. Even if I, by some miracle, could manage to provide sims with all their desires, and balance the budget, within just 12 months (game time) my city would suddenly decline, go into debt, and fail.

After some research, I found out there are a lot of quirky algorithms dictating how you can play, if you want to succeed. Many people stated you could NOT separate zoning in your cities, but had to build zones intermingled with each other. Utility stations, even clean energy/water stations, age, even if there is no indication, and require bulldozing and replacement. Trees actually affect how well you do.....Trees.....Really. To top it all off, forget building grids to help manage traffic. Grids promote fast growth, but somehow lead to sims then taking only 1 or 2 streets, clogging the transit lines, and ultimately choosing to abandon your city.

Nothing about this game is straight forward. Nothing you do to meet your sims wants works, short of hours and hours of area micro-managing. And, again, even if you somehow succeed, you then almost instantly face changes that make no sense, lead to your city being abandoned, and your budget ultimately failing.

"I believe that Sim City 4 is the greatest city building game that has ever been created. The graphics are way ahead of its time for a game made in 2003 and they are actually realisitc. The buildings look like real buildings, the cars look like real cars, and etc. You would think that todays city biulding games are improving on grpahics but they and other genre games really aren't. People now adays think that going to a graphics system that looks like a cartoon (City Skylines) is improvement, but its not, period. Though a positve is that it does have smoothed edges for those apple lovers. (1) Graphics are realistic and pretty dang good. SC4 also has more to offer, more unique buildings such as real world landmarks and gift buildings. (2) More Stuff. The management system and zoning of SC4 is also more indepth as there are I beleive 12 different distinict types of zones that you manage. There are 3 main zones that you lay out based on density, Commercial, Industrial, and Residential, but within those, you control the taxes of 12 types of zones or groups of people within those main three. For instance, Industrial has 4 types of businesses that you virtually control by rasing and lowering the tax rates for each one seperately. You have Agriculture, Dirty, Manufacturing, and High Tech Industry and the Tax rates that you set for each of those businesses will effect how each of them is demanded in the city. A high demand in manufacturing for instance, means that manufacturing businesses will set up shop in your city until the demand resets itself. (3) More Management and Even More Stuff. The only thing that I can see might turn people away for a legitimate reason is the fact that SC4 does have a square grid pattern, but even though it has a grid pattern, you can still make roads and etc go diagnally. Balance this small negative with the Good Graphics and there is no reason you should not get this game. No debate, there is  more to do in Sim City 4 than City Skylines, more management, more building, more everything.

"This game has not aged well, I had a boxed copy 20 years ago and picked it up because it was 90% off.  All you do is plop down a bunch of zones and then give them services once they complain about it.  There is next to no challenge except maybe restarting an empty city about 2 times to figure out to leave space for future highways and railroads or perhaps which type of power plant or water pump to buy that are cost effective at the start of the game.  After that you will win every time.

Also, 20 years later, the game still runs like sh-t with 50x the CPU power, occasional crashes and there's no autosave.  I don't care about mods, when you have to install community assumed required mods to make the game PLAYABLE you know you are in the wrong territory.  It doesn't matter if mods can solve the horrible lag because the base game is just plop down zones and occasionally some services.  Houses will travel clear across the city to go to work but other houses literally right next to them will forever say they are without a job and will not evolve.  The mechanic where the game saves you from bankruptcy by magically offering basically free money via shady deals like having a military base for extra money a month is just bad game design.  It tries to make it sound like they thought it out by making the surrounding areas undesirable but any 6 year old can figure out, just put them all in a corner of the city and leave a big gap so nothing is affected, so it's basically a mini little cheat code.  You can also just spam loans (they let you take out WAY too much) and instantly spend 100% of the loan on new zones, you make way way too much money even on top of the loan interest.  Also, the fire fighting mechanic is absolutely stupid and just wastes time, I quite literally think they were trying to make up an excuse to prevent players from just walking away and letting the game run so they can skip to what little fun can be had when you get money again.  Thanks to all of this most of the time you zoom in on unused space in your city (so that the game runs fast) and press the highest simulation speed button until you hit a fire.  If you do that work you now have bought yourself the fantastic ability to plop down more zones!  Such fun.

For a real and challenging city builder, check out Impressions Studios City Building Series, like Caesar 3, Pharaoh, or Zeus.  You don't need mods to play those except they have source ports now to play them at hi-res, at least none of those mods change anything about the base game, meanwhile everyone defends this and insists mods are part of the game because it is so bad.  Playing SimCity after playing any of those makes SimCity feel like a console or mobile game for little kids.  Most of the other reviews are nostalgia goggles which is pretty telling.  SimCity was always dumb there was just nothing better at the time that would have been sold at Walmart  (Just kidding, Impressions City Builders were there at the time and better)" , 0 , 2 , 0.435506224632263184 , 2 , 0 , 2023-05-22 17:13:43 , 329

"             This game used to be very fun to play even on low end computers, and I have only recently found the perfect most quickest way to build a very large city at a fast pace (without the cheats). Yet after two occurences already I have found SimCity 4 lacks a very useful tool that most games actually have and is very useful for those on a roll so to speak and has little time to think about 'saving' the f'ing game this tool is known to many as, bear with me now, AUTO-SAVE. What?! How?! Oh My God?! Yes I know what your thinking, and I know this will never be implemented into this 12 year old game so i've given up.

              Since SC4 dislikes the player actually doing good in a game and/or working hard while having fun making the best god damn city man has ever seen! i.e. SimCity 4 says: BEGONE UNHOLY CREATURE FOR YOU HAVE, uh...

I bought this POS because TotalBiscuit recommended this back when the new SimCity was released.
Do not make the same mistake as me, if you're expecting a newer and better version of SimCity 3000 or 2000.

The game is just horribly clunky and taking itself too seriously. The UI is horrible even after the tutorials explaining it. It's missing stuff from 3000 and 2000 (I don't honestly remember what anymore, because I wanted to forget this game exists). TB explained it was a good thing to take the boring things away, but I felt I was missing a lot of essential things building a city." , 0 , 2 , 0.413212001323699951 , 0 , 0 , 2013-12-28 12:29:47 , 93

"Meh. Honestly, I think this is a very niche game. I can see why some people can love it and invest many hours playing it. People that like management and budgets along with those that like relaxed stuff, the way some like gardening, gonna find this game quite good. Me, I'm not driven by nostalgia. I tried this for the first time this year and I find it rather boring. Few events, few surprises, the same crisis and there are no goals but your own. The graphics are not bad for an old game. There are plenty of mods available. 

Found no bugs. Runs fine on Win 7.

I don't recommend it. I really think is a game that was probably fine many years ago.

"This is a good game and all for it's time, but if your computer can support Cities skylines, I would recomend to spend your $20 on that. If you have a low end computer that is like 1.8 GHz and maybe 4 GB of ram on a small laptop, I would recomend this because Cities Skylines would probobly be to big of a load for that little Asus or whatever you have. Now if you have a 3.4 Ghz Machine, with some Navida Graphics card and 1TB of space (which I do not have) then I do not recomend buying this, because there is so much more you can do with Cities Skylines. I got Sim City 4 when I was 9 years old (2011, I think) and I very much enjoyed it, but it didn't have the rush hour expansion. Then a year or 2 later, I got the Deluxe edition and enjoyed it very much. Then I bought this for $20, but if you really want this, I would suggest to wait for a deal or offer.

I messed with it for two hours, and finally decided it just couldn't be worth it.  I spent twenty minutes trying to make a highway, and none of the pieces would connect, no matter what I did about on-ramps and ground-this and clover-leafs-that.  I even went through half of the tutorials before I played.  Worse than this is how often you build an area that builds itself streets that aren't connected to existing streets or builds plots that can't access a road.  And can you just bulldoze them?  No.  I also wasted fifteen minutes trying to make the land appropriate for a beach—seriously?  Why not have the beach auto-teraform if you're going to make it so picky?  Add in the screaming idiot always calling to you to try his stupid roadway adventure (i.e., boring arrow-tapping exercise), and you have an intolerable game.  I'm so disappointed.

The game GLORIOUS nostalgia aside is WONDERFUL, it is Cities Skylines without the corporate euphoria of making everything a DLC and from an era when EA weren't so aggressive with their all divine corporate insight of wrecking things for profit.

The game has NO DLC of course, so disasters and playing god are included. It is essentially the forefather precursor to Cities Skylines like how the classic Roller Coaster Tycoon is to Cities Skylines's Roller Coaster tycoon counterpart.

When I played it back then I messed around built cities which didn't actually function or just use disasters on my brothers already made cities for fun hahaha... And to be honest, I still don't know how to play and do the same thing with prebuild cities for the nostalgia xD

"Ok, had the game long enough now, so time for a review. PS, this is a base game review, as I do not believe that mods should be the saving grace for any game as if that is the case; it reflects a major failure in the core game.

Whilst I wouldn't say it is a terrible game, I would feel dishonest in giving it a whole hearted recommendation.

The graphics were a nice improvement over it's predacessors and the terrain customization feature was a brilliant idea. Those were the things that I liked about it. What I did not like about it was... well, almost everything else. 

1) I hated the way you could just click and drag to build a city area, though that is probably just me, I get a great amount of satisfaction in tweking every minor detail myself. I feel that alone took out a lot of immersion from game play.

2) The absolute worst feature, I think, personally was the city zones. You could have different sized zones that you could micro manage until they're full, if you wanted to. If memory serves, zone sizes could range from 1 Kilometre upto 10 kilometres. And whilst the concept was interesting, it just felt like I was managing multiple cities, rather than one big cities individual zones. Cities: Skylines pulls this off wayyyy better. It also took the AI neighbour cities away from the player. Which I thought was a great feature, the way it was implimented previously.

3) Ok, so there are a few more things I liked about it. I liked the interface. Was easy to understand and navigate. and I liked that you could get up close and personal with your own city by driving inside it and performing missions, getting money and rating boosts as a perk.

4) The things I like about it though does not make up for the things I dislike about it. It is monotonous and in the long term, boring. It feels like a massive downgrade from simcity3000 and I WISH they'd have put that game into steam, rather than THIS one as SimCity3000 was by far the better. Inmy most honest but humble opinion, that is.

kinda shows in the fact that I have had the gamefor years now, and have a grand total of almost 26 hours -.-
I'd give it a four out of ten score and would NOT recommend it. If you had not guessed already." , 0 , 6 , 0.379544883966445923 , 0 , 0 , 2017-07-08 11:39:24 , 1541

"To start with the game seemed fun and the issues minor however the following issues cause me to not recommend the game 
1) Crashing frequently, loosing the last half hour - 3 hours of effort (as inevitably I have not saved since the beginning of the session)
2) I find the tax system both too simple and too controlled - Not able to tax anything more than 20% and not able to do tiered taxing, e.g. first $100  earned per month is tax free, then the next $100 is at a low tax rate, then a medium tax rate and anything over $500/month is at a high tax rate. Also having people leave due to high tax rates. Not sure if this is how it works in America but in England everyone has a personal allowance (currently approx £12,000) then you are taxed at a basic rate of 20% for anything up to approx £46,000 then a higher rate of 40% up to £150000 and anything above that is taxed at 45%, I understand that this is a game so can't be overly complex but not being able to charge more than 20% tax is prohibitive and having the tiered tax would be more realistic.
3) There are other areas where it would be helpful to set the rates but I can't see where to do so - such as changing how much toll booths charge and saying that certain roads or streets can only be used by certain vehicle types. The traffic also does not move in a logical manner, I will have a street with a dead end at the end of it and big lorries go down it only to turn around at the end and return the way they came.

"Don't Buy This Game!!!!!!! Buy City: Skylines in you're actually looking for something you can enjoy!

Cities: Skylines is better 100%. Sim City 4 is basically unplayable, and is a game worthy of 2004. Cities: Skylines has excellent water mechanics, and brings new things to the table with it's DLCs. Sim City 4 is so difficult to play in my opinion, in part to its horrible graphics and slow movement. The disasters of Sim City 4 add nothing to the game. The terrain mechanics suck (terraforming), and your city is basically locked into one grid (In Cities: Skylines you can purchase excess area). There is no easy way to incorporate mods if you want to build a visually appealing city. Don't be fooled by the glow that Deluxe seems to add. This game is a poor excuse of a city builder, and if you hear otherwise, you're being lied to. 

In my personal experience, Sim City 4 only warrents 5-10 hours of gameplay, based on the fact that it seems unplayable. If you disagree with me, you can buy the game and see how horrible it actually is." , 0 , 3 , 0.362619996070861816 , 1 , 1 , 2018-08-26 14:40:17 , 173

What a missed gem i had sitting there.  Absolutely addicting and fun game.

"Well its an old game now but what makes it truly obselete and any game that follows this pattern of city building simulator is its style of civic engineering is obselete. Theres a better way to build cities of the future now built in layers with residental ontop and commercial at the bottom and no roads or cars for local transport. Google The Venus project and you will see what I mean. Still if you want to expierence just the management side of things this game still offers you the capatalistic approach.

i was so dissapointed with it i tried taking it back

"SimCity 4, in case this is your first time ever seeing a computer, is a tycoon/city building game where you allocate land into Residential, Commercial and Industrial zones, build roads and power infrastructure, and encourage people to come live in your city, watching their buildings grow and the streets fill with bustling traffic. 

Fantastic idea and SimCity 4 is arguably the best of all of these games for the simple fact that every city building game to follow this has been greedily, evilly butchered, with the majority of content stripped out and then sold back to the customers as massively overpriced DLC.  SimCity 5's $10 Marina addon (just so you can have boats) and the community backlash was one of the factors that may have lead to EA's CEO at the time resigning.    Cities Skylines is even worse than Sim City 5 for anti-consumer greedy DLC gouging.

So, why am I not throwing this one the thumbs up it once truly deserved?  It's simply too dated now.  There's no widescreen support.  There's no HD support.  It's a little buggy and badly optimised, it doesn't run so great under Windows 10.  The game will never be updated to properly support modern PCs.  It's really a shame.

The region view is a waste of time. Literally. You can't do anything there, and your cities don't talk to one another once they are up and running. There's even still a graphical glitch on some cards.

Get into the game and you are plagued by constant pop ups, to the point where you cannot concentrate on being a mayor for ordering fire engines to put out fires. The minute you start placeing government buildings like schools all your staff start striking.

The easiest way to progress and have a working city is to use lots of low density zones, power them with wind and water them with towers, have no agriculture, no public buildings, no transport or utilities. Your scumbag city will sit there and generate a nice wee income and you can tinker at the edges.

But try and build a thriving metropolis and be prepared to be bothered out of your wits by endless advisors.

Never had a problem opening the thing. But, back when I got it, there was no involvement with the demons at EA, who seem to want to get their claws into everything offered on Steam.

"**SimCity 4 Deluxe Edition Review**

**Overview:**
SimCity 4 Deluxe Edition is a comprehensive city-building simulation game developed by Maxis and published by Electronic Arts. Released in 2003, this edition includes the base game SimCity 4 and the Rush Hour expansion pack, which adds several new features and improvements.

**Gameplay:**
SimCity 4 Deluxe allows players to build and manage a city, from zoning land for residential, commercial, and industrial use to managing the city's budget, services, and infrastructure. Players can oversee transportation systems, utilities, and public services, ensuring that their city runs smoothly and efficiently. The Rush Hour expansion introduces new transportation options, including one-way streets, avenues, and the ability to control individual vehicles with the U-Drive-It feature.

**Pros:**

1. **Depth and Complexity:**
   - SimCity 4 offers a deep and complex simulation experience. Players must balance the needs of their citizens with the city's budget, manage resources, and plan for growth and development.

2. **Detailed Graphics and Sound:**
   - The game features detailed graphics that bring the city to life, with realistic animations and vibrant cityscapes. The sound design complements the visuals, providing an immersive experience.

3. **Customization and Modding:**
   - The game's strong modding community has produced a vast array of custom content, from new buildings and landmarks to gameplay tweaks and enhancements. This extends the game's longevity and replayability.

4. **Rush Hour Expansion:**
   - The expansion pack adds significant value, with new transportation options, scenarios, and the U-Drive-It feature, which allows players to take control of vehicles within their city.

**Cons:**

1. **Steep Learning Curve:**
   - The game's complexity can be daunting for new players. Understanding the intricacies of city management, zoning, and infrastructure planning requires time and patience.

2. **Performance Issues:**
   - SimCity 4 can be resource-intensive, especially on larger cities, leading to performance issues on older or less powerful systems.

3. **Lack of Tutorial:**
   - The game lacks a comprehensive tutorial, which can make it challenging for newcomers to grasp the mechanics and features without external help or guides.

4. **Dated Interface:**
   - The user interface can feel dated and cumbersome compared to more modern city-building games. Navigating menus and managing city elements can be less intuitive.

**Conclusion:**
SimCity 4 Deluxe Edition is a classic in the city-building genre, offering a rich and detailed simulation experience. Despite its age, it remains a favorite among fans for its depth, customization options, and the added features of the Rush Hour expansion. While it may have a steep learning curve and some performance issues, dedicated players will find it a rewarding and immersive city-building experience. If you enjoy complex simulations and city planning, SimCity 4 Deluxe Edition is well worth playing." , 1 , 0 , 0 , 0 , 0 , 2024-07-03 11:34:59 , 10

"SimCity4 is a legacy game that still has a lot of love from its loyal community. If you're looking for support, you can find it here on Steam or on www.simtropolis.com, where there are a lot of mods available and a lot of still-loyal fans of a great game. 

Yes, the graphics are dated and official support has ended a long time ago. But the game is a classic. It is easy to get lost in its simplicity. If you're looking for a good city simulator that was only upstaged by City:Skylines, than this is for you!" , 1 , 0 , 0 , 0 , 0 , 2024-06-20 10:03:04 , 6593
"Does not play well on windows 11. Has to be forced to fit the screen properly otherwise it either won't open or you have to change your resolution a ton just for it to play ini the middle of the screen with black bars on the sides.

"[h1]Summary[/h1]
The OG old school city builder simulator that still holds up.

[b]Pros[/b]
+ Fun sandbox
+ Simple complexity

[b]Cons[/b]
- Outdated graphics
- Tinkering required to run properly

[h1]Overview[/h1]
Sim City 4 is an old school city builder simulator that will likely appeal more to the older generation as it has dated graphics and is more of a nostalgia play for many, though it cannot simply be regarded as an outdated city simulator as it is probably still one of the best in the genre outdated as it is.
Most will probably also notice that the game uses a lot of the (older) The Sims UI and even the character models for your advisors as this was one of the games made by the original Sims developers, Maxis the kings of simulators of their time.

[b]NOTE[/b]
Do check out [url=https://www.pcgamingwiki.com/wiki/SimCity_4#Essential_improvements]PCGamingWiki[/url] to ensure you get some patches and mods to run the game and / or improve the game for an even better experience.

[b]Gameplay[/b]
As a city builder simulator you will be building a fully functioning city dealing with all its needs such as water and power, maintaining the happiness of your populace, and also balancing the city economics with taxes and commercial and business sectors.
It sounds rather complex but overall not actually too difficult to play as the goal is to simply make a city, you can make a nice little one or attempt to make gigantic metropolises but in essence the game is a simulator so there isn't really any winning conditions. You are also not really limited to playing the game properly as there are some funny options you are able to do such as trigger disasters just to see the chaos. There is also drive mode that puts you in a car letting you drive within your city streets or off them if you so choose, this feature likely came from one of their other game Streets of SimCity if anyone remembers that.

9.5/10 with the NAM and some QoL mods, available through community sites.

"SimCity 4 in 2024 still holds up as a competent and impressive city builder and one of EAXis' most tremendous accomplishments to date. With a few tweaks to run smoothly on modern systems there is a wealth of opportunity to build and develop thriving regions with millions of residents. Mods are still being updated to this day, which stands to show not only the dedication of a still lively fanbase, but the game's merits to still be experienced today. The graphics are charming and well done and manage to not look outdated for a game released over two decades ago. The mechanics are suitably detailed and complicated but not convoluted to grasp, which is a balancing act not many titles manage to handle. I'd definitely recommend giving it a go if you haven't played, or coming back to it if like me, you've had a long history with the franchise but haven't found the time or motivation to play in a while. I've sunk hundreds of hours into SimCity 4 since the mid-2000s and I'm confident I'll continue well into the future for as long as it continues to work on modern systems.

"SimCity 4: Balanced the budget with nuclear readiness!

City builders are to me what heroin is to a normal person, and in some aspects they're at least marginally more affordable for me. And much healthier. But the issue with city builders has always been logistically trying to improve on the basic form factor. SimCity to SimCity 2000, then to 3000 and the various divergent evolution paths that go everywhere from there. Roots going to PopTop's Tropico to the Caesar/Pharaoah Games. And after so many years of zoning out to Skylines, I was feeling the itch. The urge, the monkey on the back demanding I waste another afternoon erecting a massive tower of terrible skyscrapers.

And then I remembered I had SimCity 4, had failed to make a city operate like an absolute weenus and then decided to do it properly. And then it took me one slightly ambient soundtrack and it hit me. That and then immediately getting BODIED by this game requiring you to actually budget versus huffing paint thinner and taking out loans with no consequence. This is that dreaded missing link, that Colossal ran with. 

The subsequent games in the franchise, both by Maxis and by Colossal really undersell the city builder. It's really easy to set something up to be a money printer in Skylines, meanwhile SimCity 4 will throw you and your administration under the bus if you don't do your job right. Everything in this game is the correct delicate balance of things, which is my excuse for not building schools until we're at least 2k in tax profits. Everything must be laid out perfectly to make sure you can actually build some level of office space, otherwise you're going to make your city look like Extended Baltimore. 

Plus you do have the silly but neat feature of forcing your Sims 1 characters to live in your dystopia, which is useful to help gauge the individual issues of the city. You think it's a gimmick, but I routinely have used them like some sort of informant network. Works better than the advisors who are helpful, and routinely yell at me for streets I'm refusing to fix. Realistically I need the suffering of my people.

The only gripe I can ever lay at the foot of this game is the stability issues, which after two decades have been pretty reasonably patched out over and over again. Go dig around the forums, stab the fan patches into ancient code and you should be relatively good to go. And you get to have all of the city building fun without the legally mandatory 30 Paradox DLC's that take your regularly priced indie game and make it cost more than anything else." , 1 , 0 , 0 , 0 , 0 , 2024-03-13 09:14:40 , 751

However, this game is still fantastic, the advisors, the funny little details, the ability to drive around and the entire atmosphere of the game as a whole holds up pretty well today.

"SimCity 4 Deluxe, released in 2003 by Maxis, is a city-building simulation game that takes the helm of urban planning to new heights. As the mayor, players have the responsibility of designing, building, and managing a bustling metropolis. The Deluxe edition incorporates the Rush Hour expansion, introducing new features and challenges, making it a comprehensive experience for city-building enthusiasts.

What I like about the game:

SimCity 4 Deluxe stands out for its intricate simulation mechanics. It delves deep into the complexities of city management, offering a realistic portrayal of urban dynamics. From zoning decisions to managing budgets, every aspect contributes to the city's growth or decline. I love building train tracks that go round and watch Sims going on a circle train ride.

Despite its age, SimCity 4 Deluxe boasts charming graphics that capture the essence of a growing city. It has a vintage 2000's PC game look that makes it quite enjoyable. The isometric view allows for a detailed look at your creation. The soundtrack, composed by Jerry Martin, adds a delightful touch, enhancing the gaming experience. Basically more aesthetically vintage looking than Lethal Company or Baldur's Gate 3 so = better.

The game provides an extensive array of building options, allowing players to create unique cityscapes. The ability to customize terrain, implement various transportation systems, and design intricate neighborhoods fosters creativity and replayability. I personally like the burger restaurants they look like they cook absolutely awful stuff.

To spice things up a bit, SimCity 4 Deluxe presents players with a variety of challenges and scenarios. From natural disasters to economic crises, these events keep the gameplay engaging and provide opportunities for problem-solving. Actually this is annoying but I guess some people like challenges like speedrunning a loli simulator or else.

Not to mention, the game has a dedicated modding community that has extended its longevity. A plethora of user-created content, ranging from new buildings to complete overhauls, adds an extra layer of depth and variety. Little silly goofy mods can be added to have a good laugh on a tuesday evening.

Stuff I did not enjoy tho:

SimCity 4 Deluxe is not the most accessible game for newcomers. The intricate mechanics might overwhelm players initially, and the lack of comprehensive in-game tutorials can hinder the learning process. I still don't understand sh*t at this game. I hate my dumb self.

The multiplayer aspect is limited, especially when compared to more modern city-building games. Collaborative or competitive multiplayer features are minimal, limiting the social aspect of the game. I would personnally love a split screen mode and a friend to play with.

The user interface feels somewhat dated, lacking the sleekness of more contemporary city-building games. Navigating through menus and managing city details can be less intuitive for players accustomed to more modern interfaces. I don't know how to quit the game.

On modern systems, SimCity 4 Deluxe can face compatibility issues. Players might need to apply unofficial patches or tweaks to make the game run smoothly on newer hardware. What do you mean it's not ready OUT OF THE BOX?? o_o

General opinion:
SimCity 4 Deluxe, despite its age and the car icons that launch missions you can't do, remains a hallmark in the city-building genre. Its depth of simulation and creative possibilities set a high standard. While the learning curve and dated aspects may be deterrents for some, the game's charm and replayability make it a must-play for fans of the genre. Its enduring modding community and the timeless joy of constructing and managing your own city make SimCity 4 Deluxe a classic that continues to captivate urban planners and virtual mayors alike." , 1 , 0 , 0 , 1 , 0 , 2023-12-01 04:50:06 , 276
"The game's over 20 years old and it's still fun.  I keep it on my older 2015 Macbook, and it's the perfect game to play when I'm sitting in an airplane.  Still runs great on old hardware, and makes the time absolutely disappear." , 1 , 0 , 0 , 0 , 0 , 2023-11-29 13:14:08 , 2711
"It's a classic, challenging and deep.
It looks great and plays great 
Balancing numbers, making short and long term decisions, making sure your advisors are all happy and that your city is actually making money is rewarding and a thoughtful puzzle.
Hell, you can make your own sims 2 neighbourhoods in this which is a great feature. 

That being said this is an old game so expect it to get a bit unstable once you start pushing it, there are community fixes avaliable of course. getting the game to run properly at a higher resolution is difficult so those with very high resolution displays might be getting their squint on.

It's a good price and dosent have a mountain of overly expensive dlc tumored onto it, you open it and you have everything you would ever want from a game like this.

It came out in a time when rectangles were 'out' and ovals were in.  The isometric ui scrolling works, but it dated. It does not take advantage of the entire screen space.

"-- Pardon me while I nerd out --

Greatest city-builder of all time.  

No other game in the genre has ever come close to developing the same amount of character and sense of community SimCity 4 has.  If you want a true problem-solving city-builder where your mission is to strike a balance and grow your *cities* (that's right, you get regions of interconnected cities that you can terraform), then try this classic out.  If you can manage to grow a skyscraper the likes of Hogan Wallace and White Insurance, then consider yourself a veteran of the game.  Just don't forget to enjoy the journey.  Every city you build has 'you' within it, and you get to revisit your creation anytime you want.

Don't skip on this work of art.

Thank you to Will Wright and his team at Maxis!  I've been playing this game since 2007 (2009? I don't remember, exactly), and I'm still learning all of it's intricacies and enjoying it like the day I picked it up from the store on a CD.

"Amazing for it's time period, doesn't hold up for today's standards.

~~~ From a 90s perspective ~~~
As a 90s child who used to construct LEGO towns, I absolutely loved playing this city building simulation! This game was somewhat simple, so it was easy to grasp and understand as a young child. I never really looked into the budget, only to 'Legalise Gambling' for more income. It was exciting to have your very own town or city digitally on the computer, but you were somewhat limited with what you could do. The natural disasters never really interested me to be honest.

This was a single player game and I much preferred to play this in my own spare time. Sometimes though, I was sadly pressured into situations where I was forced to watch someone else play SimCity games. It was not fun or enjoyable to watch someone else play SimCity games single player. I don't see how a multiplayer CO-OP mode could work for such games, but could have provided an 'interesting' experience.

~~~ Modern perspective ~~~
The game has aged horribly in comparison to other modern city builders. Impressive titles exist such as Cities: Skylines and we will see Cities: Skylines II. Hardware and technology has come a very long way. This game has probably inspired other city building simulations as well.

~~~ The Sims 2, creating custom neighbourhoods using SimCity 4 ~~~
SimCity 4 is a handy utility for making custom neighbourhood layouts for The Sims 2 Ultimate Collection. You can load up SimCity 4, lay out your road layout, and import that into the Sims game.

It's just an old classic game that still looks good. However, starting the game can be difficult as it is not as easy to earn money as in cities skylines for example.

While the game can be intricate, it's not difficult to pick up, especially if you have experience with more recent city builders, since a lot of them were influenced by SimCity games. The real challenge comes from building multiple cities and connecting them, maintaining balance throughout each of them working together.

...and quite frankly that's why I can't play it again. It hurts to see how Maxis thought the world worked back then.

"Now, if you're a fan of simulation games, then you're gonna love this one. SimCity 4 is all about building and managing your very own city. And let me tell you, it's a blast.

First off, let's talk about the graphics. For a game that came out in 2003, SimCity 4 still looks pretty damn good. The cities are vibrant and detailed, and the animations are smooth and fluid. And if you're into modding, there are a ton of options available to enhance the graphics even further.

Now, let's talk about the gameplay. SimCity 4 is all about balance. You have to manage your city's finances, build infrastructure, and keep your citizens happy all at the same time. It's a delicate dance, but when you get it right, it's incredibly satisfying. And there's no shortage of things to do in this game. From zoning to transportation, there are countless options to customize your city to your liking.

But what really sets SimCity 4 apart from other simulation games is the modding community. There are hundreds of mods available, from new buildings to custom transportation options. And if you're feeling adventurous, you can even download mods that add entirely new features to the game. The possibilities are endless, and it's a great way to keep the game fresh and exciting.

In conclusion, if you're a fan of simulation games, then you need to check out SimCity 4.

"SimCity 4 is the best city builder ever released to this day - even better than Cities Skylines. Unlike Skylines, SimCity 4 can support colossal mega cities of over 2.5 million people without a performance hit. Sure, it can't take advantage of modern day hardware and won't run at super high framerates, but it's consistent from when you're laying down your first low density residential zones to when you've filled up the final grid spot in a city. The modding community keeps this game alive and it can be expanded infinitely without taking eons to load like Skylines does. 

There's plenty of useful community-made patches which vastly improve the game. Search these up and install them before you start playing:
-IH Missing Jobs Fix
-SC4Fix
-IH Quadrupler
-Opera House Fix
-HippoTank Demand Fix
-Private School Fix
-Web Button Improvement Mod
-SC4 Launcher

If you have the patience, look into using a DirectX wrapper such as DgVoodoo2, as it will make the game run slightly better on modern hardware.

Finally, there's also a colossal mod that's been in development for almost two decades called the Network Addon Mod (NAM). Many players consider this essential and it's been a long time since I played without it.

"Before Cities: Skylines...  There was only SimCity 4 as the greatest city builder since 3000, 2000 and the original game.  Societies was an interesting experiment, but then there was the disaster of  2013's...  SimCity, the game meant to succeed SimCity 4...  ERRRR WHAT?!?!?  Everyone knows SC4's true successor was Cities: Skylines!
Skylines allows you to expand your city...  SimCity 4 let's build an entire COUNTY!  The map is divided into tiles of varying sizes where you can establish town and cities, ultimately giving you the ability to setup those all-important utility deals (Power, Water, Garbage, etc.).  Like The Sims you can easily make some asynchronous gaming fun around taking turns building up your cities and making deals with each other.  Speaking of The Sims...  If you have a working copy of The Sims 2, you can make your own makes to create worlds from in Sims 2.
Between Cities: Skylines and SimCity (2013), the comparison is night and day!  SimCity 4 on the other hand...  Between Skylines easy moddability and SimCity 4's ability to build up an entire county of cities, it's kind of hard to play favourites here.

"SimCity 4 is a classic city building simulator. Among the best in the genre. It follows a basic gameplay loop, design and build-up a city (or many cities on one map). It is dated, and can be a bit jarring for those used to the more refined city builders these days, however it would be a missed opportunity not to have this in your Steam Library. Even as a game you play for a little bit here and there. There are also many good in-game features including making or importing your own Sims to place in your city, starting both natural and absurd disasters to rampage in your city, and a driving minigame that allows you to drive around the city you built from a topdown view. 

A classic. A game I can recommend from my childhood.

"Hey look it's a SimCity title from back when SimCity was good!

SC4 will forever be my favourite SimCity. The gritty look of it is an aspect i msis dearly in modern citybuilders that somehow all seem to look like backdrops for children's animated TV.
The only downside this classic brings with it is the classic instability of software around the early 2000s. Expect lots of crashes." , 1 , 0 , 0 , 0 , 0 , 2022-10-09 14:26:22 , 40

"This is probably my all-time favourite game. Ever.

Seriously, this game was like, 50% of my childhood. Ignore my Steam playtime, I played thousands of hours of this back in the day.

So it may not be the only big-name city builder in town now that we have Cities: Skylines, but I think there's still some things that this game does better, ever nearly 20 years after its release. For example, you have whole regions rather than individual cities, although individual cities in this game are smaller than their C:S counterparts. (A medium SC4 tile is roughly equivalent to a C:S starting tile) I'd argue that this game, being [i]technically[/i] 2D with an isometric view, allows for much more detailed and realistic buildings that you get in C:S, especially vanilla stuff.

What really makes this game great though is the same thing that makes its de facto successor great - the community. Over the years there has been some amazing custom content released for this game, and while there's no workshop support, there's plenty of guides out there for installing mods and custom buildings available from all the major fansites such as SC4Devotion and Simtropolis, among others.

Be aware that this is an old game, and it doesn't always play nicely with modern hardware. Like before there's guides to get this game running as well as it can on modern systems, but even with all that you will run into slowdown as your cities grow. A major limitation of this game is that it's single-threaded, so even the latest multi-core processors may not help much. This game will crash sometimes as well, so you'll need to save often.

There are tutorials in-game, but with these types of games I always think the best way to learn is by just playing. There's no shortage of tutorials out there for everything from basic city planning to interchange designs (using the Network Addon Mod) and more. This really is an all-time classic, honestly one of the last truly great games to come out of EA. Speaking of which, there's none of that Origin nonsense here, so consider that a plus.

Honestly I could talk forever about this game, but I'll finish it here. Just buy it. If you have even the slightest interest in city building or management games in general, you'll like this.

"Pros:
- It runs very well for a 20 year old game
- It has all of the great things that a city builder should have
- Unlike Simcity 2013 and other games that came after, SC4 has bordering cities that you can play as that allows for regional RCI demands
- Nice reward system
- Decent tutorial that can be skipped
- Plenty of mods that can be downloaded

Cons:
- Random crashes that can occur (SAVE OFTEN)
- Unrealistic traffic (Can have a population of 14,000 and need to place highways)
- Unable to create curved roads without mods
- Unable to make profitable small towns unless you finesse a bit
- Some mods make the game significantly slower or can crash it

The old graphics have a good style to them that looks very detailed despite being borderline pixel art, too, and the biggest thing...REGION MODE!

Sure, there's now heaps of newer games in the genre, with mods and whatnot, but I still keep coming to this one, once or twice a year and notice something I haven't noticed before.

Being almost twenty years old, this game has some issues, it mainly has to do with newer hardware. So, it may run sluggishly with larger cities and sometimes even crash. If there's a game I'd love to see remastered one day, it's this one. I sincerely believe that it could catch new breath, with better support for modding and new content - it worked for AoE. Sadly,  I know that with Maxis gone, there's a slim chance of that ever happening and probably one day, in next twenty years or so, this game will become just a precious memory." , 1 , 0 , 0 , 0 , 0 , 2022-04-12 05:05:21 , 2109
"SimCity 4 is one of my most played games of all time. Considering the times I spent on Origin, GOG, Steam, and on the disc, I would have spent over 10,000 hours. It is a game that is unspeakable in its profound experience and replayability. It has charm and character that modern city builders are missing and a level of incomparable depth and difficulty. It's older than some people on the planet (over 16 years old!), and it still holds up in graphics and systems. It's a game that is still better than Cities: Skylines and one of the last great EA games. How can I forget the soundtrack! It's amazing! Can't I forget that you can get it for dirt cheap?

It has a very active and passionate modding community (shout out to Simtropolis and SC4 Devotion). Mix in a couple of mods and fixes, such as Network Addon Mod (NAM) and CAM (Colossal Addon Mod), and you got something that is complex and very enjoyable to play. The only complaint is the game's age, it can be very choppy, and loading can take forever on modern systems. The game can be buggy, and you need to get fan-made fixes (such as crime does not pay and opera house fix). The game's camera angle, a fixed trimeric (not isometric!), can make things difficult to see when you have lots of high-density buildings.

The game has interconnected regions where you can mix urban and rural together, build small farming towns or build a large metropolis—the transportation systems in this game rock. Build complex highways via Real Highway (using NAM), and you can drive vehicles. God mode is an exciting idea before crafting your city. There are advisors to yell at you. There's goofy messaging, a Mayor Rating and even riots (although extremely rare)." , 1 , 0 , 0 , 0 , 0 , 2022-03-30 03:52:46 , 5690

If you don't,  then don't buy  this game and go for cities skylines instead.

But if you do, and you can deal with some of the instability that comes from playing a game from 2003 in modern systems, then take a few hours to learn about Sim City 4 and you'll discover why people are still playing this almost 20 years later.

"Still very good after all these years. I've have owned this is many forms, well 2. The original CDs and then on Steam. If you buy this make sure you look up the mods for it, the Network Add-on Mod as it fixes lots of issues that were never patched or resolved.

I'd say its even better than Cities Skylines. I prefer the art style of this and its much more detailed regarding the city simulation. Cities Skylines is good but feels more forgiving, where as this really feels like a real live city.

As mentioned, mods should be looked into if you want to get the most of this game now due to its age. Small part of its history, which I learnt the other day is the road simulation was very good and advanced for its day. So much so that unfortunately the PCs of the day couldn't run it very well, so the mechanics of the road simulation were decreased so they wouldn't slow the PCs down. Meaning buses etc take less passengers so you may always have traffic issues. However with the Network Add-on Mod you can customise the road/traffic system back to how it was originally designed making the game a lot more realistic.

This holds nostalgic feeling for me and I hope this game continues to be playable for years to come." , 1 , 0 , 0 , 0 , 0 , 2022-02-12 17:21:04 , 1191
"Sim City 4 Deluxe edition is an old game that still keeps on giving today. I bought the game because I cant afford Cities:Skylines with all its DLCs and my computer is a bit old to run that game. It has been the best purchase in years and cant stop playing Sim City 4 now. It has tons of transportation options, has solid gameplay and its not difficult to get into (at least for me). I recommend to look for a couple tutorial videos on how to install it correctly and which mods are essential to run the game today, also is a good a idea to watch a couple tutorials to have an idea of the gameplay since it can be a bit hard for new players.
The best thing about SC4 is the awesome community around it that keeps adding tons of new content: gameplay changing mods, new buildings and new maps.

"I like the isometric graphics, since I'm an adult and don't want to see the bright colors intended for children.
I really enjoy building up the region and I mostly ignore the prompts from the advisors. I like that it's a game that you can lose if you get over zealous and give your people ALL DA SOCIAL SERVICEZ. I really enjoyed the mini game in which you have to take money bags to the new location for the casino. I created this thing called the ghettoville challenge. Basically you try to make a city as ghetto as possible, but you have to provide power, water, and trash and conform to normal zoning standards. I'm wondering if you can actually get kicked out of office for being corrupt, while it's common for newbs like my friends to go bankrupt. Also it's hilarious when newbs place power plants right next to residential. 

I'd like to see this game have a come back. Most of the Simcity discordsphere is into SimCity BuildIt which I quit playing after it made me wait 50 seconds to produce nails to upgrade some of my first houses.

The best mod for this game is the network add-on mod, colossus add-on mod makes it hard to load, the functional seaports mod will not install even when I extracted all of the dependencies.

I wouldn't recommend the network add-on mod for beginners. The basic function of the network add-on mod is that it makes people more likely to use public transportation similar to cities in Europe rather than America.

The game works well on windows 10 and 11. If you're installing a blank map, create a new folder in the regions folder and copy in the blank configure file this will usually be a blue (0,0,255) bmp file.

The most common fix is the software to hardware switch.

"The only SimCity I played before SC4 was the original Nintendo version on SNES. 4 is a big jump from the first game in terms of complexity and interlocking systems, but it's really rewarding and fun to figure out how everything connects. The tutorials are super helpful in explaining how the simulation works. My only complaint would be how obnoxious navigating the terrain is. The original SimCity was 2D, so everything was gridded out on a flat plane. SC4 takes into account mountains and valleys, canyons and erosion. It's fun sculpting out the space but building on slopes and beaches is so finicky. Some of my Sims go to school on sheer cliffs because the game will automatically carve out a giant square brick in the earth if the lay of the land is too wacky. Oh well.

"Probably the best classic Sim City game. Much more challenging than Sim City 2000 or Sim City 3. 

Money is a constant problem; you have to be strategic about building new schools, hospitals, police stations, fire stations, highways, etc. because the upkeep for everything is very steep. Traffic and pollution are also significant problems you have to contend with. Relief from your money problems finally comes when you educate your sims, promoting them to the middle and upper classes, and when you create high-tech industrial factories and commercial skyscrapers for them to work at. 

One thing to know is that the AI path-finding in the original game is broken -- unless you install a mod to fix it, all sims drive to and from work using the (geometrically) shortest possible path. This leads to frustrating situations such as sims preferring to drive on roads instead of using your trains, subways, and highways, or sims all driving on one road when there are multiple roads available that could reduce traffic. Personally I fixed this issue by installing the Network Addon Mod (NAM), which you can find using Google. 

I had fun replaying this game from my childhood and building a much larger and more successful city compared to what I was able to build when I was in middle school. That being said, the game doesn't have much replay value; once you've built up a city as big as it can possibly get, with all reward-buildings unlocked and built, I don't see any reason why I would ever go back and do it all over again." , 1 , 0 , 0 , 0 , 0 , 2021-08-23 20:36:25 , 1744

It's telling that there's really only one big-budget rival to this game (we're not counting Sim City 2013)--Cities: Skylines. And that won't run on my computer so...SC4 it is." , 1 , 0 , 0 , 0 , 0 , 2021-08-17 16:37:42 , 670
"Before Cities Skylines was hands down the best city builder in the market. Great graphics that still hold well today, straightforward gameplay, if you are willing to put up with the isometric 2D gameplay, and lots of mods in external websites such as Simtropolis.

Unfortunately it is not designed for newer computers and multicore processors, and takes not only little benefit from them but also crashes often as well.

10/10 10 years ago, but right now 7/10. If you are interested make sure to download NAM - it is pretty much a must - as well as mods of your choice." , 1 , 0 , 0 , 0 , 0 , 2021-08-15 18:26:24 , 42271

"Classic Game, detailed and requires a quite bit of strategy. This is as good as it gets. Better than Cities: Skylines, and the massively disappointing SimCity 2013. Game is 20 years old at the time of this review, and the creators went out of business long ago, so there will be no updates. Because of this, there are compatibility issues which often steers new players away and cause them to leave a nasty review. However, it doesn't have to be like this; there are easy workarounds to most of them with little research!

For running the game above 1080p, this guide is a must follow!
https://steamcommunity.com/app/24780/discussions/0/1471967615838569110/

For crashing issues, the most common culprit is the game utilizing multiple cores when it was made to only handle one. Use -CPUCount:1 in the launch options. Still save often, as there could be other reasons your game crashes and they may not have a resolution. Besides, its a good habit.

Finally I recommend every one download and install the latest version of NAM (Network Addon Mod). NAM is essentially a mod that combines a bunch of useful mods. It provides you with extensive and detailed road, highway, rail, subway, etc., combinations. Even if you do not wish to use these features, it contains its own traffic simulator that changes the path finding and parameters of the infrastructure to reduce traffic greatly and make it more realistic. It is worth gold for that alone. Plus it is completely free.

"I enjoy matriculating splines. If you don't know what that means, these are the words mentioned every time you created a new land mass to conquer in the original Sim City. Sim City 4 requires you to play a more active roll in creating your land masses. That has it  good points and bad. You don't have to put power lines over roads for power to get to the other side which means the whole quadrant is powered so long as the adjacent one is powered. That's nice.  I am still trying to work out the cost/revenue matrix which means I have not achieved the success I had in the earlier game. Also, I don't like being limited to adding only $1,000 at a time in their command line. They added a SIM person option to the game which I played a little and it will be more fun once I have conquered the skills to master the economics of city growth.

"Pros: 
Sim City 4 is definitely a classic. It is a basic city builder that allows you to build multiple cities in one region. You can spend hours of your time building and creating different roadways and networks to your enjoyment. If you are brave enough, you can even mod the game (look up a tutorial). The game is simple to understand and is fun to play.

Cons:
For SC4 being an almost 20 year old game, it is surprising that it can still even run on modern day machines. With that in mind, SC4 does crash alot and can lead to you loosing progress, leaving you to have to manually save alot. The graphics are not the best, yet not the absolute worst. The game is not receiving updates at all, so any bugs that are in the game now, are in it forever. 

Price:
Is the game worth $20? The Simple answer is no. The good thing is that the game goes on sale quite often. So i would pick it up when it is on sale.

Recommendations:
All in all, i do recommend SC4. Especially if your just stating to get into city building games. If you are looking for a more complex game built for modern machines. I recommend you check out games like Cities: Skylines :)" , 1 , 0 , 0 , 0 , 0 , 2021-04-23 22:28:30 , 346

 Unlike some games that are similar that has an endless ( it would seem) number of dlc's attached to it that only serves to gouge the customer of every penny that greedy companies count on rather than include even the most basic mechanics that should be part of a city simulation.   
   This game does not have that, yet, it is a very complete game.   There is also a wealth of mods for it, which you can find at Simtropolis assuming you can get an account.

"I've owned and played the retail version for years off and on.  I've not played any newer city sims because I've heard bad things about them when compared to this one.  It's a shame the series peaked here.

I've seen some other guides on Steam for fixing graphic or performance issues, but I've not had any serious problems getting the game to run normally either the retail version nor so far the Steam version (should be identical).  There is no native widescreen support and the game doesn't have a native auto-save and WILL CRASH at random times sometimes so be sure to SAVE FREQUENTLY.  When this game came out, it was very intense on the single CPUs of the time and even today you may have graphical glitches and issues.  The day/night cycle in particular can create rendering problems but you can lock it to Day.

There's also some mods and patches you really should pick up.  I found one somewhere that fixes High Residential jobs fulfilled by High Tech Industry that's bugged in the original (they create demand but don't fulfill it, causing your high residential properties to go abandoned when they can't find jobs).  There's one for the Opera House too.  There's others, but those are the only two I've got added right now.

This SimCity is more complex and granular than previous ones and for the uninitiated it can be overwhelming to balance all the different demands of your citizens.  Losing money is easy, making it is not.  Just know that you don't have to build everything at once and if you don't have the money to support something, just wait until you do.  There's a lot of variables and some of it is not coded the best (there are mods out there that fix traffic issues too)." , 1 , 0 , 0 , 0 , 0 , 2021-04-11 07:56:09 , 81

"This is absolutely a great game,.
Yes, old, but great.

(This review is mainly focused on the gpu, isnt about the how great or interesting the game is, if you ask, then I do recommend this game means everything.)

But it cant use Dedicated Nvidia card on Windows.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

For Laptop Users:
If you're on a laptop, which use integrated card as display, then you need to be awared that this game doesn't support Nvidia Geforce Gtx (or rtx, but I dont have a rtx card), you can find that under system requirement/supported graphics chipsets (on the store page).
I mean, this game will not accept any card except the display card, as of my understanding after trying for couple of months.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

TL;DR: 
I have tried everything to let the game run on my nvidia gtx card, like adding my dedicated card string and pci id to the graphics rule and video cards respectively, that didn't work (btw, there are tonnes of different pci id of my gtx 1650, of different version, I did add all of them to the video cards.sgr file, but of course, that didn't work).
Of course I had tried to set the game using high performance gpu, at the time of writing this, windows overrode the gpu selection of nvidia control panel.
After, I deleted all ATI strings and vendor cards information on those files I mentioned before (because my integrated card is an AMD gpu), and that still didnt work.
EVEN, I tried to disable my integrated card on the device manager, then the game REFUSED to be launched!, I cant believe how stubborn it is that it doesnt want to be played with dedicated cards.
THE DEVIL!
(You might ask, why I must use dedicated, instead of integrated? That's because the integrated one cant run this game smoothly, that really affects my playing experience, AND I think it's UTTERLY a shame that it cant even run a 2003 game smoothly!)

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 I first enjoyed the game with my old macbook air, which only has an intel 5000 series gpu, but I enjoyed the game with most settings set at medium or low and resolution only at 1366x768.
That was a really great experience, then, I wanted to play the game on my windows laptop, which had a lot better gpu, and absolutely can run this game with max setting and resolution at 1080p.

Then the nightmare started, actually nightmare isnt accurate, time wasting could be the better word to describe this:

Firstly, I didnt know that the game cant recognise modern dedicated gpus, after the first time of launching the game which I didnt find the fps counter, and then when building a big city that the game is lagging, I realised that the game wasnt using my dedicated gpu, which was gtx 1650.

Then, later I searched on google for a lot of times, wandered on different forums like metropolis, wondering for answers and solutions of this, and, I found a thread, which its content was about adding gpu strings to the graphics rules.sgr, and adding specific graphics card pci number to the Video cards.sgr.
I followed every step of that guide carefully and correctly, but it failed.
Reason? Well, I thought it was because some unknown problems occured or I didnt follow those steps correctly, but that was completely wrong.
After this failure, I retried those steps of the guide again and again, about 4 times later, that I had already tried some solutions like: uninstall the game completely, and reinstall it; restart, etc.
Except reinstall the system. (I cant reinstall windows 10, because it contained many important files to myself, and I have no space to store them, that was about 2 terabytes.)
As the tl;dr section mentioned, I also had thought that maybe I didnt add those information sufficiently, but all of them didnt work, I couldn't imagine how frustrated I was.
(I suppose the person like you whom would like to read such long texts would not dismiss the tl;dr section, wouldn't you? 😉)

So, lastly, after trying all whether normal or abnormal solutions, I was defeated, I surrendered. 
All of these wasted me months of time, I really don't have any mood and thought to play this game anymore, it's definitely waste of time, without any payback.
Maybe the next I would like to play this game again should be when I have a  current dedicated gpu level integrated gpu (having little confusion, aren't you?), the game with my current integrated card is just running like a rubbish, with full of lagging and crushes.
(I do know that the game uses 1 core will prevent some problems, I also tried that, with command line and set to only use 1 core, but the game was running even slower than ever before.)

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

So my advice is, if you're using laptop, and really care such thing like lags and low frame rate, then you can just give it up, make yourself cup of tea or coffee and play other games or do other things, this game is lacking of hope (nothing is absolute, isn't it.)

About desktop users, I'm not actually really sure if it can work, because I dont have a desktop, I will update this if I can have tested.
And possibly, on desktop, you may need to change display gpu to the dedicated one, I think laptop can only use integrated card is because it cant change display gpu (The gpu which display and illustrate everything on your monitor).
The result is high possibly may differ in distinct circumstances.

"This was definitely an experience. It made me think a lot more on the concept and ideas of city planning and zoning. The base, vanilla game is fun and a delight for anyone looking for a game to make a neat city. Looking towards mods opens that vanilla experience up into a different plane of possibility that the vanilla game was going for, but ultimately fell short on. Sadly, I believe I will not be playing this game further, mainly because I wanna move on to other games and partly because the possibilities can be a bit too much and end up being daunting with mods attached (and I couldn't go back to vanilla, right?). 

If you  wanna play this game casually, I'd recommend it. If you want to - or develop the need/curiosity to - get more meticulous with your city, commuting, and trade amongst your other cities, I 100% recommend this game." , 1 , 0 , 0 , 0 , 1 , 2021-02-07 14:13:26 , 3092
"The game of my childhood and absolutely the best among all SimCity serie. The gameplay is not intuitive, and this is one of those games where to really learn it you must spend the hours and get experience. The graphic, for those who appreciate this genre, is even better than the most modern city simulation video games and offers fantastic views both during night and day worthy of a desktop background for pc or to hang in a picture. The mods make the game more realistic and boasts a very active community even today that realizes high-level content (buildings models and gameplay improvements). I don't think it's ever going to be too late to try it, so much so that it would almost need a remastered edition adapted to the most modern PCs.

"Highly recommend but not at over USD 5 , Buy it when the price around USD 5 .
The reasons that it is still a great game. I played the simcity 1 and simcity 2000 years before .
1) Can run without problems in windows 10 at 1920 X 1080   , but you need to change the launch options manually in steam . Just copy and paste can do that (guides in steam). I played hours without any crashes .
2) You can a big big city , even bigger than the cities skylines . And you can run smoothly without the poor  performance in cities skylines (even you got i9 10900k or rzyen 9 5950X ) , cities skylines still cannot run smoothly . 
3) No more DLCs , you buy one you pay one and you get all the contents .  
4) Because the game is so good , now the price is over USD 5 in steam now .

Buy in if it is on sale (USD 5 or less) , you wont regret that ." , 1 , 1 , 0 , 0 , 0 , 2021-01-18 12:13:23 , 359

"Imagine not being able to build mid-rises and create a genuine transition between lively city centers and zombiefied Americana-spam. 
Imagine having zoned structures limited to a mere 1,024 square meter area because the zoning only extends outward 4 eight-meter tiles from every road. 
Imagine not being able to play with multiple cities and connect them into a living network. 
Imagine not being able to have elevations higher than ONE. FUCKING. KILOMETER. 
Imagine not being able to actually use your glorious one-city tile of 299 square kilometers because the network length capacity hard-coded into the game is too small, and they actually want you to use an area smaller than a big city tile in SC4. 
Imagine having to potentially dismember your city every time a new traffic jam occurs- and that said traffic jams can occur at any time of the day or night because the citizens never sleep and the factories and stores never close.
Imagine having your population capped at 1 million and your vehicle activity capped at SIXTEEN THOUSAND! 
Imagine needing to get computers as expensive as fucking down payments on new cars, because otherwise you won't be able to build JACK SHIT! 
Imagine that! Oh wait you don't have to imagine. Just play Cities: Skylines. 

Detriments to SC4: 

-you need mods to make the road network more flexible (NAM is a pain to get my head around though)
-water has a set height and does not flow from higher to lower elevations (at least it doesn't randomly flood like C:S)
-camera cannot be adjusted to any angle whatsoever, is stuck in birds-eye at every rotation and elevation
-buildings are stuck at angles of 45 to 90 degrees from each other as are most of the roads, which cannot curve easily
-autobuilding streets in zones sometimes spam without regard for the encircling road network, this also goes for the directionality of buildings in R/C zones
-corner road connections turn into endless traffic generators that fuck up regional demand and are never resolved
- crashes due to being too old for these multithreading CPUs (but it just went ~16 hours before it did on my PC, though I was mostly in region view) 
-many more, give me enough time and I will remember all the flaws.

Now, both of them have problems. And I did overinflate Skylines' ones. Maybe. Just a little. But they are also THE TWO BEST CITY-BUILDING GAMES OUT THERE! (and the only ones I've played, hehe, unless Surviving Mars somehow counts oh wait freeways and trains are banned from Mars, nvm)

Just fuse them together into one game that takes the best of both. Hopefully you won't need to decide between paying bills (or a new car/house/whatever) and a new PC for it.

"This is an all-around fascinating and engaging game.  You can engage with it on a number of different levels, from playing on easy mode and letting your advisors point you toward building a conventionally successful metropolis as the requirements slowly grow with the population to attempting to use your vast intellect to micromanage your city with a deft hand and iron fist to make it the most minmaxed metropolis in existence.  My favorite part is the terrain editor — not because you can play god, but because it lets you construct interconnected series of cities that really look, from the map overview, like a real place.

"SimCity 4 is one of the last great 2D city simulators. The art style is absolutely breathtaking and gorgeous. 

Initially playing more modern games like City: Skylines left me thinking I could never go back to older simulated systems. However, SC4 still does such a good job with its systems that it left me astonished when I finally came to play again. It does suffer from a lack of clear direction that can lead to hours of trial and error to figure things out. But the cities you get to discover along the way make that process fairly worthwhile. A trial by fire, the player certainly feels their efforts are earned, whereas sometimes more modern city simulators feel like they hand you some successes on a silver platter (which is not a bad thing--I appreciate that C:S makes some mechanics easier for a noob such as myself). 

SC4 is a beautiful game and one I love to come back to see that beauty, even if I have to stumble a bit to figure out how to make it work." , 1 , 0 , 0 , 0 , 0 , 2020-12-21 14:01:33 , 1403
"Despite the low play hour count on my Steam profile, I have played and sank in many hours of this game way back in the days of Windows XP on my Pentium 4 PC.

This is in my opinion the best game in EA/Maxis' SimCity series. I found SimCity Societies and SimCity 2013 to be both so disappointing. SimCity 2013 should have been called SimSuburbs with it's super small maps and the extreme level of micromanagement was simply too much. I guess I was just expecting the classic formula.

And this is where SimCity 4 shines. Having grown up on SimCity 2000 for Windows 95, SimCity 4 basically had the SimCity 2000 formula perfectly refined and with great detail, for a game made in 2003. It has the right amount of city management, without becoming overbearing which instead allows you to focus more on building and expanding your city. Some of the maps are simply massive and can take many hours to fill up. When you build roads they don't just appear out of thin air, you see construction crews laying down the pavement. This is the level of detail this game had, and it was in 2003! What's more, with a game that is now 17 years old, it's definitely not subject to any hardware limitations today so you never get any slowdowns on the simulation, even at max speed!

But that's not to say everything has aged well. Zooming in closely to see the buildings and vehicles will unfortunately show their low resolution assets clearly on LCD panels compared to the CRTs of those days. The user interface by today's standards is a little clunky, but its not all that bad. The game lacks proper widescreen support, but it's easily fixed by just adding a few command arguments to the shortcut for the game (just Google how to make SimCity 4 widescreen). It's just unfortunate they haven't taken the time to make a small patch to the game for this after all these years so that users don't have to modify the game shortcut themselves.

This being the deluxe edition, it includes the Rush Hour expansion pack, a great addition with new transport options, traffic management tools, and added songs to the soundtrack. Did you know you can even drive the cars in this game, though from the same top-down view (as it is the only viewpoint)? It can be fun to lose hours driving around your own city, exploring everything up close, or speeding your car and crashing to make chaos at intersections.

And let's talk about the sound a bit as well. SimCity 4 and Rush Hour have an absolutely fantastic soundtrack, very fitting for city building. They are actually memorable songs and you may find yourself thinking about the music even when you are not playing the game. That's a good thing, as I find there aren't many games that leave you with a soundtrack that you end up remembering years later. The soundtrack is even available on Spotify, which I keep in my library and listen sometimes when doing work. The sound effects are certainly passable for a 2003 game.

If you were ever a fan of any SimCity game growing up, you will likely enjoy SimCity 4. And if you are a fan of Cities: Skylines, you definitely should check this game out as well. Considering the messy, terrible disappointment that was SimCity 2013, which is nothing like the classic SimCity games, I have always considered Cities: Skylines to be the spiritual successor to SimCity 4.

These days I am spending tons of time in Cities: Skylines. It's similarity to SimCity 4, but on a modern game engine in full 3D, makes me want to call it SimCity 5 if I could. But I always find myself going back to the roots of it all once in awhile, and boot up SimCity 4 and have some fun in it. And when I'm on my old laptop instead of my gaming PC, it makes a great pastime since my old laptop can barely run Cities: Skylines, with single digit frame rates.

Would I recommend buying this at full price? No, not for a 17 year old game. But if it's 75% off during a Steam sale? Then absolutely you should scoop this up for some nostalgia goodness! Explore what I would consider to be the best SimCity game of a previous era, one that EA has simply never been able to match since 2003." , 1 , 0 , 0 , 0 , 0 , 2020-12-17 22:59:24 , 43

"As someone who played this game a LOT as a kid, I've come back to it every now and then because of how good it still is. Obviously not as graphically impressive as something like Cities: Skylines, but that just means more power can be used to properly simulate a realistic city population without setting your gaming laptop on fire. I'd argue the terraforming terrain tools are almost just as good, and you can even drive cars around the streets of your city AND add your own custom music in the menus. You can pretty much make your own GTA with this game.
There's no integrated workshop for addons, but I strongly recommend checking out places like Simtropolis.com and SC4Index to properly pimp out your game with loooooads of great mods.

I'd say if you want to get into this genre, this is a good place to start (I had also tried Cities Skylines, but getting the power, plumbing, etc all connected to every building just seemed like a bit much for me)" , 1 , 0 , 0 , 0 , 0 , 2020-07-27 17:36:32 , 43
"Gioco veramente fantastico a differenza di Simcity 5 (2013)
Regioni ampie e possibilità di personalizzarle come si vuole, meccaniche fantastiche e non mancheranno i soliti problemini da sindaco, che, col tempo e con la pratica risolverete in poco tempo.
Certo, il gioco è vecchio e la grafica lascia un po' a desiderare, ma se si ha un computer scarso è una valida alternativa a Cities:Skylines, in quanto non dovrebbe presentare molti problemi vista la grafica molto semplice.
L'unico difetto (Opinione Personale) è la mancanza di un sistema Multigiocatore. Anche se, vi è possibile tramite l'uso di qualche modifica e di qualche programma giocare tramite la vostra connessione internet con i vostri amici.
Lo consiglio veramente." , 1 , 0 , 0 , 0 , 0 , 2020-07-22 18:20:01 , 816
"Super engaging for those who were a fan of the Roller Coaster Tycoon style simulation games! However, I do think that the learning curve in this game will steer many away from playing and enjoying it to its fullest. Graphics are typical of the early 2000s so don't expect glistening smooth textures or crazy special effects. Overall this can be seen as one of the better classic simulator titles." , 1 , 0 , 0 , 0 , 0 , 2020-07-18 04:38:13 , 112
"Fun game play....as long as it doesn't crash

A good update from Simcity 3000 (for the most part, I do prefer how ordinances and advisers worked in 3000). Improved graphics and mechanics for regions are welcome updates for this game. However I am not a fan of the auto-pan feature for disasters as this has destroyed several zones I was in the middle of building. While it is cool to be able to move in sims and see their commentary, I miss the citizen comments from simcity3000 as they could have special interactions such as enact an ordinance (also more in line with actual city hearings, if you are a policy nerd like me). The god feature is kind of sadly lacking in the simple design. 

But more importantly, this game has constant crashes. Save often. The game now just wigs out when I last attempted to play (all the tool bars just keep flashing) so I have now had to uninstall, which is too bad.

While it is a fun game, I cannot recommend something that simply will not play." , 0 , 1 , 0 , 0 , 0 , 2020-07-17 12:03:13 , 3732
"To me, Simcity 4 Deluxe represents the ultimate experience regarding city building. It's a true reference and even Cities Skylines can't match it. 

Good Points: 
*Unlike CS, you don't have to spend more money on DLCs as the only one extension which has been released for SC4 is included in this Deluxe Edition.
*The extremely resourceful SC4 modding community which offers you thousands of free content even today allowing you to build a very personalized city.
*Very reliable game which works on every machine even the ones which are not made for gaming.
*Bugs occur very rarely 

Less good points:
*Graphics are pretty low regarding today standards even if it adds some charm to it.
*The weather doesn't change but it can be fixed with mods.
*Mods are pretty voluminous and often require to download extra dependencies to work correctly so be sure to have enough space on your hard drive if you choose to use mods.

Enjoy!

There is STILL a somewhat active community for SimCity 4 modding (as of 7/1/2020). Reddit and Simtropolis can guide you.

I highly recommend using the Network Addon Mod (NAM). It drastically improves your sims' transit ai and provides so many other transit options that the base game feels incomplete without it." , 1 , 0 , 0 , 0 , 0 , 2020-07-01 14:28:52 , 24564

"  (ENGLISH)
A little about SimCity.  It's a strategy and building game.  You play as a mayor and you are in charge of building the city.  The game looks ridiculous at first and discourages with its graphics or age.  The game was released in 2003. I was surprised when I turned on the tutorial and saw so many options and things there.  SimCity pulled me in, and only during the tutorial in which I spent an hour.  Gradually, I learned all the things and I still don't remember anything about it and I'll have to start it again.  There is a very elaborate economy in the game, which I did not expect as much elaborated in detail as, for example, paying taxes, paying rents from citizens and others.  The game is simply great and every builder will love it.  Some + and -  
----------------------------
+ Price (you can buy a key from the internet for less than 3 euros) 
+ many options and thing 
+ creating your own terrain for the city 
+ real economy 
+ mods 
-------------------
 -It takes until you learn to build and control properly.  
-bugs but 2003 :) 
- can become boring 
- problems on newer computers

"The best city builder out there in terms of looks, especially with the right mods. The isometric artstyle aged like fine wine, and the detail really makes it.
The gameplay is relatively simple, it becomes a casual game once you learn the economy basics. Still the rules aren't there as complex mechanics, but rather as guidelines for your bonsai-handcrafted-miniature to look realistic enough." , 1 , 0 , 0 , 0 , 0 , 2020-06-07 23:22:41 , 3692

"A great game. It is nice to have a digital copy of this game instead of the old CDs which get scratched easily due to my carelessness in simply stacking them on top of one another instead of putting them away properly.

The game is more challenging than other the other Sim City games that come before and after it. You have to manage a monthly budget instead of yearly, and even on Easy mode, you can run out of money if you're not careful.

One thing that is missing from this version of the game is an automatic region generator. It will take a couple hours to properly craft an interesting and diverse region, but I feel like it is more honest to use the pre-made regions than to craft your own.

When I make my own region, I set it up so it's easy to make ferries. In the pre-made regions, it's often a struggle to reform the land to fit the ferry buildings properly, so the cheap cost of the ferry compared to a bridge may be negated.

Replace WWWW and HHHH with your monitors resolution and it'll look perfect. 

You should also look up the Network Addon Mod and how to install it.

"Amazing game, in my opinion has greater depth than the modern sim cities. Graphics aside it really was an amazing game for the time. If you had sims 2 it would port your character over to live and act as advisers on the area and tell you if it needed improving or not (I doubt this is implemented on this version).
Its down fall was grid locks, but rush hour came out and improved road options so much you could continue to push your city to greater limits. It was a add-on that made sense, it fixed the game and wasnt just an empty money grab like many add-ons today.
If you can stomach the old mid 2000's graphics and want to try or relive this game buy it.

"Love Sim City. 4 is the ultimate to me, I know it's older and Cities Skylines is the new normal, but I just couldn't get into Skylines; don't know why. I did enjoy the townships of Sim City 2015? but it also lacked the subtlety I enjoyed about Sim City 4. In the 2015 I would just grid it out and fill each available place to the edge of the map: I felt I never truly understood the school system (like if I have mass transit or a fleet of local school buses, if I have bus stops why can't one school be enough so I can limit population, but also educate my work force.) It just never clicked for me, aesthetically it was nice to look at... but I'm getting way off point, SimCity 4 has everything I want and I always come back to it every four months for some reason.

"Don't let my hours fool you. I probably have like 2k hours in this game, however 99% of that was on non-steam versions. Anyways, I'll review this with my typical pro/con style to keep things simple.

Cons:

1. This game likes to crash, and this seems to be an issue that is exclusive to the steam version. Expect your game to crash every 2-4 hours regardless of the size of your cities. My advice, save as often as you can.

2. This is an old game, so it doesn't play nice with higher resolutions. This is a bit annoying as there are constantly black bars on either side of my screen because this game does not offer 16:9 aspect ratio. Again, this is to be expected as it is an old game. Supposedly there are some workarounds for this issue but I haven't tried very many of them myself.

Pros:

1. Mods!!! You aren't playing this game right if you don't have an account on both Simtropolis.com and SC4Devotion.com

2. Probably one of my favorite video game soundtracks of all time. Its absolutely perfect.

3. The community is still going fairly strong even in 2019. If you have any questions or technical issues with this game, there is no shortage of help to be found on the forums.

If you like city builders, do yourself a favor and get this game. Also, if you're curious as to what is possible with mods, head on over to the True Earth Journal on Simtropolis. It's truly mind blowing what people have accomplished with this game.

"While quite old at this point, it's still a solid citysim experience. And it's the last classic Simcity game before EA done fucked them up. The biggest downside is that all cities look like they're from the USA. No postclassical buildings here, no old town city centres. It's all just modern styles (well, except for the landmarks). Then again, there aren't many citysims that include that anyway, so meh.

Generally, what's fun in this is that you do get to build relatively realistic and detailed cities. Yes, Cities Skylines is way better at that, but it was also done with much more modern technology. This came out in 2003 after all. But you have three zone types (Residential, Commercial, Industrial) with three degrees each (Light, Medium, Heavy), except for Industial, which also includes Agricultural zones as a separate one. You get to choose between a decent variety of power generation, water, and waste disposal facilities, and also have to think about providing educational healthcare, security, and firefighting services for your citizens. Parks and beautification has tonnes of options, whether parks of various kinds, plazas, or recrational facilities like ball parks, tennis courts, playgrounds, or even beaches and marinas, listed from smallest to biggest. Public transportation is an option for those who want in, with the classic bus/train/subway options available, as well as larger scale alternatives such as ferries, cruise ships and aircraft available as well.

It's got most of what you want, and what these categories don't include, you can receive as rewards for achieving certain milestones or completing certain missions (you can drive cars around your streets and roads!). This includes universities, military bases, research facilities, highsec prisons, administrative buildings, a statue of yourself, you name it. Naturally, SimCity 4 also comes with its fair share of Landmarks, buildings you can plop down anywhere that will generate some tourism for you. These have a bit more stylistic variety, drawn (mostly) from all over the developed world. The range of available buildings, however, feels much more limited than in SimCity 3000, sadly.

If you get bored with building and managing your citizens, you can always send some natural (and some unnatural) distasters their way. Complaining too much? Send a meteor strike, a tornado, an earthquake or a volcano to ruin their day right back. Or if you're feeling like adding that little extra, you can always send flying saucers or a giant space robot (i.e. Servo from The Sims 1) to blast them to smithereens. Sometimes, it's intensely enjoyable!

All in all, the limited features compared to Cities Skylines makes this game definitely show its age. Still, this is one of those big classic games that set the bar back in the day, and it's certainly the best among the SimCity series. If you're into management games, I can wholeheartedly recommend sinking some tens of hours into this game, if just to experience it, as an extra alternative to the other management games you might have." , 1 , 0 , 0 , 0 , 0 , 2019-12-02 12:59:20 , 558

"I know is a very old game, but I still like it very much. With compatibility mode for WinXP SP3 works very good. I had no crashes at all (I usually play in sessions over 2 hours).
If you're a classics fan, for sure you will still like this game. It's difficult to review it almost at the end of 2019. Basically, you build cities, you can connect the economy of a city with another: have a city where you only build factories, and a city with people who can go work for the factories. This way, your city with people is not polluted, you can also have a very rich city where you just sell resources to other cities (like water, power, garbage space).
I believe for its time, and beyond is very well taught. I have looked at new city building games, and other than the graphics, they haven't impressed me with cool mechanisms.
You can also have missions to help your citizens escape the city (after winning some money). You also get a chance to build a casino by doing these missions. There's also the option to be the police and catch the guys. This won't give you any money, but at least you will make people happy and like you as a mayor. Depends what you need: the votes or the money?
When the game sees that your funding is going down, you receive buildings which bring profit. But don't place them near your population, they bring pollution and unhappiness to your citizens.
It feels good to be the mayor, organize different cities for economy, population, resources. The building is not very complicated, but if you want to make a beautiful city, I recommend some tutorials or just investing some time to discover the tools you need.
Overall, it's a very good and simple building game. The graphics are outdated, of course, but the gameplay offers the satisfaction of winning over your cities." , 1 , 0 , 0 , 0 , 0 , 2019-11-23 06:29:15 , 484

Though not without its faults, the game does keep one entertained in creating and governing a city, or several cities that are interconnected on the regional map. The game has aged quite well and the graphics looks pretty decent given that the game is over fifteen years old at the time of this writing. If you were one of those kids that played with building blocks or used a lot of imagination, then you'll likely find something here--it's almost cathartic watching how your precious city and the countryside that you've created come alive in the game. Observe how your masterpiece grows and becomes populated by Sims as they go about their daily lives, and act accordingly! The level of detail--visually and managerial--is honestly quite good. Later on, you can even take a short break from the city-building aspect of the game to do optional missions within the city such as flying a medical helicopter to save a citizen's life, wrecking havoc like a lunatic in an army tank, or evading the police in your hijacked car with its indecent bumper sticker. It's like GTA-lite.

Nostalgic as the game is, the game has several flaws. It could mar your enjoyment of the game momentarily or it could become an exercise in frustration. An accidental misclick or two could be quite disastrous--and there is no Undo! (Hoped you saved.) Getting objects to align and orient correctly is sometimes difficult. Made even more difficult for certain users (i.e., some laptop users) who must use a combination of keys to click Home and End (which rotates objects) while attempting to hold down the mouse key without movement in their click-and-drag operation. (Go where I want you to go, dangit! I need an extra arm!) The tutorials within the game are, frankly, inadequate. What they do cover, they do well. However, given the range of tools you have on-hand in building your city, it falls woefully short. For example, the game's tutorials nor its manual cover anything about how to properly connect highways to your city's existing infrastructure; and mistakes while figuring things out like this if you don't know how beforehand can cost you dearly. (Nooo! Don't sink that entire city block into the sea...) And unlike other versions of SimCity, including older iterations, there are no random map generators nor challenge scenarios, and one wonders why that's the case. Heck, you cannot even simply load new regions into the game without some legwork outside the game. That's an outright fail. Fortunately, there is a vibrant community of mapmakers for SimCity 4, and there are programs and guides that makes things easier. Despite a number of hassles and issues like these, the game does fulfills its aim at being a great city-building, simulation game.

"The game is, in my opinion, the best in the entire seris. Combined with the fact that it is on steam, it makes this game alot more acessable to those who dont want to download EA's terrible hardware on their own PC's.. and i find it funny how both the (Arguably) Best Sims and (Arguably) best Simcity game are both on steam, while the rest is on origin.

"I love citysimulator, and this game is old time favourite.

unfortunately compared with it's competitor, this game is
how i said it...cubical still. the simulation is made sense altough the city taking the grid system for simplisity just like american city p;aning in some city. 

the dlc help to patch it's limitation. but damn.... those growing is ruthless and confusing.

example
[
my bus station is packed, so i build another one in hope to split the load. what happen is the bus station that originally there had a hike on number of passenger, while the new one is completly empty. just wtf ?!

in short, if u new to city sim, this is the intro to city simulation. it include most stuff to manage city, but not complete or even emerssive.

TLDR: Franchise that gave birth to the genre failed to bring it to the modern age. Play Cities:Skylines instead. Dated UI and primitive engine here. 

Management games are complex things, under the hood, and often in operation as well, finding games that can marry that complexity, while offering all the wealth of details to the player while not hurting the learning curve or interactivity too hard is a difficult balancing act. 

The Sim City franchise set up the foundations, but somewhere along the lines became as much about its own brand name than the genre itself, and it ended up getting outcompeted.

This game is stuck somewhere between WIndows XP and Windows Vista in terms of user interface and game design conventions.

 Removing permanently for declutter.

"Holds up to the rigors and tests of time, which is more than I can say for this game's predicessors. That being said, 2000 will ALWAYS hold a special place in my life and heart (as it was on PlayStation when I didn't have a computer and the music on PSX was WAAAAAAY cooler than PC). I played SimEarth on SNES and SimCity on the same, I then played 3000U on PC. I loved that game, it helped me to waste away staring at a computer screen and satiate my need/desire for micromanagitis. Sim games are a dime a dozen, GOOD sims are rare. This one - having rather nice expansion packs (now-a-days called DLC *groan*) such as Rush Hour, and the classic Maxis SimCity music - most of it done by Jerry Martin and other very talented artists - is a great upgrade to 3000U. The Simnation alone had me sold. The ability to have more than one city on a massive nation-map blew me a way. I felt like this game was far ahead of its time and felt like the next step, where 3000U felt like 2000 with pretty graphics and a few new things, and whatever the new SimCity game is - it feels like a gigantic step backwards and sideways into microtransactions and the obvious advantage-taking of a fanbase that EA aquired - one that Maxis earned. This is the last great SimCity game, for me, and will remain the last one I play. (Cities: Skylines is fantastic, and a season pass plus game equals a complete-feeling experience). I still show people this game, and introduce them into the world of SimCity (Maxis) and this is the end-all for them and me." , 1 , 0 , 0 , 0 , 0 , 2018-09-05 09:49:58 , 24

"Game recommended as long as it is under $10.

Yeah, it's an older game, but it's still a decent city builder.
It's fun to build multiple cities next to each other and manage neighbor trade deals.

My main complaints in terms of the game itself are that you need to save often because of crashes (they're not frequent, but they are random and often very inconveniently timed), and that when you do the Rush Hour stuff, cars will appear out of nowhere (literally) and destroy whatever you are driving, thus making you fail the mission.


The game has its drawbacks, bad spots and sore points -not being able to rotate a building you are putting in, the reluctance of people to take any kind of mass transit unless you make it impossible for them to drive (thus limiting your own capabilities in missions), the way some missions are designed or end up generating due to RNG fails (Don't get spotted by an ice cream truck.. by the way, 2/3 of the cars are now ice cream trucks, Drive the train from the station here to the one behind you... by the way there's no reverse, Catch the robber before he drives out of the city.. by the way we're spawning him 10 seconds away from the edge of the city), but really... there is no perfect game and overall, these are fairly minor problems.

If you're after a decent city-builder with a bit of nostalgia and still use Windows 7... this is a good game to look into -as long as it's under $10 (really... if it's over $10, don't get it. I bought this exact game -with Rush Hour and its other expansions-  on CD for $20 and that was 8 years ago... don't get it if it's more than $10)." , 1 , 0 , 0 , 0 , 0 , 2018-05-25 10:56:44 , 5351
"I have been playing SimCity since SimCity 2000, but i didn't know how to play this kind of game since i'm still a kid, not interest so much about this but after several years, they come out SimCity 3000. I just watch my old brother play, it's so nice too see building pop out and growth like mushroom, the graphic so beauty by that time (era 2.5D), the best i remember is the music soundtrack.

This SImCity 4 its more advanced, more bigger and they change into fully 3D and day night effect. For me this is last good SimCity before they coming the new one, Sim City (2013). SimCity is dead by now.

"Sim City games were a big part of my childhood. I played the SNES version of the first Sim City. Then I played Sim City 2000 and noticed the improvements. When Sim City 3000 was released, I remember being impressed by the more realistic looking graphics. Sim City 3000 Unlimited added more content too. I was excited about Sim City 4 because of the fact you can build a whole region of cities. In previous games, you only built one city and can only imagine what the neighboring cities looked like.

Anyway, I liked the options for this game and the improvements in the graphics (at that time of course). It was good seeing a series evolve over time. For example, I liked how they gave farming buildings its own separate category under the Industrial option. In Sim City 3000, you had to zone low-density industrial tiles and meet certain conditions, like no pollution, before farms will appear. It is the same deal with high-tech companies even though they still don't get their own category in Sim City 4.

Now some people have complained about Sim City 4 being too complicated for beginners or casual gamers, and so EA Games ended up releasing Sim City Societies and Sim City 5. Like Command and Conquer, Sim City was an iconic game during my childhood and teens before EA Games killed them off.

As far as new city building games go, Sim City isn't that impressive anymore. During the 90s, however, it did seem Sim City was the only fun city-building game that was available so I am happy we have more options now." , 1 , 0 , 0 , 0 , 0 , 2018-05-02 21:47:05 , 15

"SimCity 4 Deluxe may have some age to it, but its still a great gem to replay from time to time. The gameplay is easy to get into - the tutorials help a lot - and I like the region system in the game - you can make use of the pre-made ones in the game, create your own, or import one made by the modding community.

I love adjusting the map tile you choose with the terrain tools, plus deciding on the difficulty you want to play on when starting a city. The graphics are good, even on modern systems; although you need some patches to improve the screen resolution to higher ratios. I also love the reward system in the game and the driving missions - they're a nice diversion with the added benefit of unlocking rewards before you have the needed requirements for them.

The only issues I have with the game is the traffic mechanics are not great, and the game may crash without warning if not patched. That said, the modding community provides a nice selection of extra buildings, transit options and themes to use, and there are some tools available to help with region creation and refining.

Overall,  the game is still a wonderful one to play, and definitely should be in your collection, especially if you love Cities: Skylines." , 1 , 0 , 0 , 0 , 0 , 2018-04-05 06:25:10 , 14303

"This is hands-down one of my most-played games of all time. And I'm going to echo what many have said here already, but it's all true.

First, the game itself is really well-designed. I mean the core of the game. Building progression, fiscal system, neighbor and region dynamics, etc. It's really something to watch the local economy grow and connect with the regional market. Civic administrators can get really, really granular about the budget and infrastructure, enough to satisfy even the most hardcore micromanagers. The in-game missions for extra mayor points are so-so, but you can completely ignore them and do just fine.

But the REAL fun and creativity comes from the SC4K community. I mean, the sheer number of mods available are simply astounding and are a testament to the passion people have (STILL) for this game. Some mods are so useful, in fact, that I simply won't play SC4K without them: NAM makes the traffic simulation much saner than stock and I take great satisfaction in the aesthetic and functional enhancements the Road Top Mass Transit Addon give the game. But it doesn't end there: you can give your entire city a visual makeover, put your hometown city hall in the game, force all trains to go _under_ streets, give your city limitless power, or even have the trees change color with the seasons!

I've played this game to death, and I'll keep playing it as long as it runs on my computer. The Steam install is painless and it's very easy to enhance the game with start options to match modern screen resolutions.

There are aspects of the game that are well worth criticism. The AI is horrendous, especially on driving missions. I cannot count the times I've failed a mission because an AI car crashed into me trying to pathfind itself out of my way because of my siren. Or the times an AI car has magically appeared on top of me, making my vehicle exploed. Or the times I've started a mission that finishes within seconds because the AI target spawned right next to the city border. Or the train missions that were initiated on the wrong side of the tracks (how can I travel east if the train is spawned facing west on a one-way track?). Or the times I've failed a mission because I have angered Uncle Vinnie for no apparent reason.
But these results of the game's age should not and cannot discourage players away from the immersive city planning, the multitude of factors that influence construction, the possibility of building and terraforming an entire map from scratch, and, above all, the customizability of the game's resources that allows for stellar modding.
If you have lots of free time or you're just looking for some mindless yet mindful fun to relax after work or school, SImCity 4 is well worth its meager price. And, much like the hopefuls still expecting Half-Life 3, I will forever wait for that worthy sequel that will take the best elements from this game and dress them in modern graphics and intelligence." , 1 , 0 , 0 , 0 , 0 , 2017-10-06 19:08:01 , 5877

SC4 has lots of mods too. region game feature is great, cause each city interacts with each other where C:S lacks. in C:S you just build one big city in one region. the game has basic tutorial, building large and succesful city can be discussed in the community. you can also just design a city without managing things thru money cheat. over all this is a great game, hope that will wright create another SC game." , 1 , 0 , 0 , 0 , 0 , 2017-09-11 01:11:23 , 294

Expect this game to crash, it does not happen often, it's kind of a rarity but it happens enough to where you should probably save every 15 minutes at least, if you play this a lot. That's it for the cons. The pros, even though it's an old game, it's worth the $20 price. This is a good buy for $20.

"Still a great city building game and nowadays will run on the most basic of laptops with a little tweaking. A little dated graphically but it takes nothing from the experience for me.  

Needs mild command line edits to run on half decent modern hardware but luckily the Steam community has a guide for everything:

http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=114840389

I still prefer just building the city of my dreams (cheat: riskymoney) rather than playing the game by its own rules so the split region maps are a bit annoying but I still had fun and could just about achieve what I wanted to.  You can edit the region maps (they're stored as a bitmap) but you can't just make the whole thing a one huge single city unfortunately.

Still, all in all a good game that has aged pretty well." , 1 , 0 , 0 , 0 , 0 , 2017-07-05 15:39:48 , 1586

"This game isn't perfect. Being released in 2003 (14 years ago!) and having almost zero updates since then means that this game isn't really made for current machines. It still works, but there are resolution issues and some minor issues that might arise (I haven't had any on this computer, but my old one had some).

However, I whole-heartedly believe this is still one of the best city-builders out there. The graphics aren't amazing but they really let you appreciate the scale of the cities you can create. 

The terrain generator can take some practice to make interesting, natural-looking landscapes, but it is pretty deep and can let you create anything you like if you have the patience for it. 
The city-builder is where this game shines though. There's so much depth to it. You start off with an empty plot of land and can basically go nuts. It's so damn satisfying starting off with a small town and slowly growing it, zoning higher-density lots in the middle of town, and before you know it you've got a sweet city. With decent education, health and stuff like parks, richer people move in, and the inner-city shops are replaced by towering office blocks, and cheap apartment blocks are replaced by grand towers with beautiful gardens. It certainly rewards patience and careful planning.

But why stop there? Make another city in an adjacent block of land and build another! Linke them up with roads and railways, and now you have neighbour cities! Now you can specialise your cities. Don't want your cities to have all that power-hungry, polluting industry? Have an industry-only city and put all your residential in another! Neighbour cities share demand, and you can even share power, water and garbage disposal between cities so eventually it'll transform from several linked cities to one massive metropolis.

I could go on, but I'll leave it there.

If you love city-builders, this game is fantastic. An older game, but can still compete with the best games of today. Definitely recommend." , 1 , 0 , 0 , 0 , 0 , 2017-06-13 09:07:50 , 6485

"I must preface this review by saying that I no longer play this game anymore. I spent years with this as my go-to city building sim. It crashes after a while so it is good to save often. It really must be modded to be enjoyed fully these days. The mod community is drastically large so there is that aspect that makes it positive however the game just isn't aging well in my opinion.

Why am I recommending this title then? I think it is good to play great games at least once even if they aren't great anymore. This was the premier city builder for so long that if you haven't played it yet then you are really doing yourself a disservice by not experiencing it at least once.

Get it on sale and see what was so classic about this game. See for yourself why this was as important as it was. See for yourself just how much better this was compared to SimCity 1-3.

"Even though it's going to be 15 years old next year, it is still the best Sim City game you can get and with Maxis axed the way it was, I think it will stay that way for a long time. I got the game on sale for $10 but was on my wishlist for years. I love how you can make your own region and the cities you make can improve and impact traffic flow and improve a city's population in the future. I've played so many hours and constructed so many beautiful cities and my region isn't even half full. 
There are some downsides of course. There are frequent crashes so be sure to save often. The graphics aren't the best compared to modern standards but you can't fault the game for that. The graphics were fine for 2003 and shouldn't bother you too bad if you just want a city sim. Also for a game this old $20 is quite expensive. Call of Duty games are the same way so.... just get it on sale which it is quite often.

"Back in the day when I pirate games to play some games. Sim City 4 is one of the game that I sent 100 hours to play and compete when I suppose to work on my thesis on somewhat old pc I bought used. Its really addicting and fun if you know how to play it. After building tons of high buildings and balanced cities, I want to record some of my cities and put my own tutorial on Youtube in my native language before uninstalling the game back several years ago with saving the save files. 

After getting job and get paid, I decided to buy this game on Steam so that I am not kind of use someone property without their permission and support the dev (eventhough EA is basically triple A game dev.)

For technical issues, its very good to play on dated pc that support Windows 7 with 45$ vga eventhough there are some stuttering on the screen where its not the common problem. 

I dont excpect too much for buying the game but I wish the publisher read this. Please add Steam Achievement so that I can feel challenged again to play.

The modding community is very well alive and you can create some really cool stuff.

"I'll admit I was late to the SImCity 4 party, playing this a good few years after it came out (this was before Steam existed, I think). I had played SimCity 2000 when it released (both on PC and Playstation 1, if you can believe that) and so I had some familiarity with the franchise. And yeah, it meets every little bit of expectation you could have for a city builder made by the guys who invented city builders.

So what is it?
--------------

SimCity 4 is exactly what it says on the box. It's a city simulator that puts you in charge of building a city. When I was a kid, I thought the goal of SimCity was to try to fill up the map as much as possible and call it good. Not the case. SimCity 4 was the game that taught me that these games require a lot of micromanagement, from regulating taxes to balancing a budget to ensuring that your virtual citizens are happy and content. It doesn't sound like a lot of fun, but the bare-bones description that I'm giving the whole process doesn't sum up the joy you feel when you finally see parts of your city develop and evolve as the game goes on.

Is there anything good about this game?
-------------------------------------------

There is so much good about this game, that this review would quickly devolve into the ramblings of a rabid fanboy. The ability to do what you want with the terrain, connect cities in the same region, and basically customize your map to how you see fit is something that makes each city and region feel like it's yours. And when you're done with it, you can select from a list of disasters to blow it all up and start over. Little things like this is what makes it easy to come back to SimCity 4 even though there are other excellent city builders out there.

The game makes building a city pretty easy, especially going through the tutorials. There's a little bit of a learning curve, and trying to rush out the gates is a bad idea. The game is about the journey, not the destination. Once you figure out how to balance your budget and take your time, your city will be growing in no time.

Is there anything bad about this game?
-----------------------------------------

The traffic, I guess. The base game starts to have problems when cities get too big. Bringing in mods help, but some of the traffic mods have a steeper learning curve than the game itself. Installing them can be a pain too, because there's no Steam Workshop for SimCity 4. Everything comes off of third-party websites.

The graphics also look dated, but then again, the game is over 10 years old. I wouldn't recommend graphics holding you back if city builders interest you at all. They can easily be looked past.

Let's talk about achievements.
--------------------------------

There are none. But the region screen is pretty cool to look at after you've worked on it for a couple of years.

So, overall, do I recommend SimCity 4?
-----------------------------------------

God yes. Even if you have Cities:Skylines (which is phenomenal, by the way), pick this one up as well. It's a little older looking, a little rough around the edges, but it's a super satisfying game to play as well.

I've been playing it pretty frequently since it came out in 2003, back when EA was still letting Maxis be Maxis and the dev team was so responsive that when the first update rolled out, it actually included UI improvements that I'd suggested.  Updates and the Rush Hour expansion improved upon its playability and it's among the earliest games I can recall that had great and easy to access community created content - they built upon the groundwork they'd laid with SC3000 and The Sims.  The version currently on Steam is the most stable one I've played and there's still a somewhat active community playing this game.

"A lot of people praise SimCity 2000 as the grand achievement of Maxis Entertainment. NAY I SAY! SimCity 4, I say, holds that crown (And definitely not because I'm too young to have nostalgia about the other one because it's 10 years older). SimCity holds a special place in my heart. From the day my dad bought me this on CD, until I bought it on Steam just for the hell of it, SimCity 4 has been the pinnacle of simulation games for me. But the fun of this game doesn't come from just nostalgia. Before handing the crown to City Skylines, this game offers some of the most diverse and intimate city planning while keeping the game difficulty below that of a real city planner. The game offers a well run city planner, allowing you to develop city a diverse metropolis while keeping you on your toes in difficulty. In reality, the games worth still lies in that same nostalgia. If you're looking for the best city planner right now, head on over the City Skylines, they've got all the upgrades that this game lacks due to its time. Anyway, if you're one who remembers this game from way back when or just someone interested in the SimCity franchise, this is your game.

👌 SimCity 2000 got nothing on this gem.👌

TLDR:
Better than SimCity 2000 ☑️
Very nostalgic game ☑️
Offers complex city planning ☑️
Difficulty easier than real city planning ☑️
The best, modern city planner is City Skylines ☑️

Years passed by and I saw that this game was available on Steam and decided to buy it to relive the days when I was younger, and I have to say still to this day sim city has aged well and Still has an active community because of the mods that are available for the game.

The only issue is, I've come across quite a catastrophic problem, I don't know if it's because my drivers recently updated or something else but one day the game just completely stopped opening up, the game would show up in the processes but then immediately vanish as if it were closed out. That was an extreme disappointment to me considering how much I played this game. 

I've looked into this issue and I can't find anything that could've caused this to suddenly happen. I won't say that this is an assured issue because very few people have ever had this problem, I feel like it may be an issue with carrying over to a more modern PC considering I run Windows 10 and the recommended OS is Windows XP.

"A great fun game even after all this time. I tentatively recommend it, however, due to serious crashing issues that completely kills progress in the game. 3 separate times now, I have been kicked in the middle of city building and had to kill the program from the task bar to restart it. In doing so, any progress not saved is lost(which is always quite a bit of progress). It's very frustrating for such a great game to operate inefficiently on newer systems(although understandable for as old as it is), but it is fun to play, nonetheless. I'm not sure if it is more directly due to my rig, but no online fix I have encountered has solved the issue.

Grab it for a very dynamic city builder, but be warned, it has a tendency to crash depending on your setup." , 1 , 0 , 0 , 0 , 0 , 2016-04-05 00:47:29 , 1186

Simcity 4 is the best city building game in its era in my opinion. Just buy the deluxe version, no more DLC, no more seasonal pass, no more additional purchases, no more greedy corporations. I gave this game a 6.75/10 score as there's better city building games nowadays, but we can't ignore the facts that this game is already 18 years old. For a 18 years old game I say this game is still playable for players who seek casual city building games, compared to newer city building games such as citi*s skylin* which is too detailed for casual gamers.

"LIke a blank canvas, Simcity 4 is a city-building/simulator game where you start from building a town and grow it into a metropolis like New York and London. You plan your road layout, where zones are located, where skyscrapers are allowed to grow and where houses are to be, you set your budget and taxation and watch as people move in to your city. And apart from the original Maxis buildings plus those in Rush Hour, you can also download mods such as the Network Addon Mod, which adds new road layouts and the RealHighway, an alternative highway system for the game, the CAM which allow super-skyscrapers to grow by unlocking building stages beyond what the game allow, RTMT which allows mass-transit stations to be placed roadside without taking additional space. Check out Simtropolis and SC4Devotion, the two main website for the Simcity 4 community.

And despite this being a 2003 game, the graphics are still realistic and detailed (see from the screenshots above) compared to modern city builders.

"How many hours, no, days of my life have not gone into this game? I don't know, but it was a lot. SimCity 4 still is the best city planning simulator ever made. It strikes just the right balance between (micro) management and sheer fun. Most remarkable about the game is that it has this great flow: at times soothing and calm, then frantic and stressing. The jazzy/atmospheric music and the pastel colours all help in creating this atmospheric sense of timelessness and universality as you are working on your city. The soundscape of cars, planes, animals, accidents all help in letting your city come to life. Of course there are faults to be found and after hundreds of hours of gameplay the game's options and diversity have been all but exhausted. City building will then no longer provide a challenge, even on hard mode. But these points are just nitpicking because there was so much fun to be had. So much wonderful creations to be engineered.

"A lot of people overlook this game because the SimCity that tends to be nostalgically remembered is SimCity 2000, but even ignoring graphical improvements, this game is superior to all the earlier versions in mechanics alone. There's a mind-boggling level of content in this game (not even including mods available online), and it's just sandboxy enough to let you do whatever you want, and yet there are plenty of things you have to properly work for. You can be a bad mayor, a good mayor, a hilarious mayor, or an evil mayor , and the game works no matter what you do.

One downside is it takes a really long amount of time to get a city to a proper Manhattan level where you start getting skyscrapers and such, but a lot of people would just consider that as a plus anyway (As for me, I'm ambivalent about it).

The other downside is that even though there is way more content than SimCity 2000,  there are no arcologies. RIP space blastoff.

What I find most interesting about this game, is it's 'region' based approach, where you are effectively creating a host of cities in this one huge region. They are all your cities, and you make them cooperate by way of deals. You create road connections etc, so that the sims can travel around. Just sit back and watch as you see your rich people go to work in a neighboring city, changing the scape of both cities in the process.

That being said it isn’t an impossible task and doesn’t make it a bad game.  As far as city building sims go this takes the cake.  Forgetting that sim city 5 ever happened this is the best sim city by far in the franchise.  The game has solid gameplay that makes it fun for everyone.  For those looking to get into the finite details of their city the game is for you.  Those who want to build a simple city and have fun, then you’ve found the right game.  It may not look as good as cities skylines and it may have a monotonous soundtrack but that doesn’t mean it’s any less fun.  Now that the internet is a larger thing than when the game was released the modding community is huge.  There are countless mods to download and add to the game to add more fun.

"I am enjoying this game tremendously, it is well worth the $5 it was on sale for in the steam summer sale. The tag line is something like 'build the city of your dreams'. Unfortunately it is a little too simplistic to achive this, but it is quite challenging and enjoyable as is.

The name is quite self-explainatory...
You build your own world and then cover it in cities. In building a city, you layout property zoning and manage the provision of civil services to make sure all the little people ('sim(s)') have what they need to be happy and healthy.

It does have some dissapointment to offer...
The game casts education, labor and wealth in a very narrow-minded way. Just about all of the civil services you have to provide your people are education-related, and the only incentive to give them education is to make them more successfull and promote wealth. More wealthy community = more features and money to play with. In reality education is a life-long process. You spend your whole life learning as much as you can (ideally). Posing education as all about wealth is basically saying life is about wealth. If that is all your life is about, you are indeed a pitiful creature. I wish the design of education in the game would have been done differently. The simulation aspect of the game is very rigid. For example, if you don't want your people being brainwashed, you can kick the church and military out of town, but it won't affect anything but your city income. In reality, that would likely improve the education and crime rates of your community, but the game does not simulate with that level of depth. Your choices do not affect the gameplay, it will always happen the same way in every city. Do it right = more money, not = game over.

... but it is still fun, and even at times exciting.
You really have to put some thought into how your city should be made. There are many basic principles you will pick up on early in the game, but every time you think you have it all figured out, you will discover new problems and reasons to re-evaluate your strategy. Every city will probably be better than your last, and the progress is represented graphically in the types of buildings your people construct. Early in the game you will get mostly little boring buildings, but as your population grows accross your entire region (after you make a few decent cities), the buildings get bigger and cooler and house more people/jobs. One BIG PROBLEM with this game though is that it is very crashy. If you don't save ragularly, you will likely find yourself losing decades of development quite often." , 1 , 0 , 0 , 0 , 0 , 2015-06-19 15:39:18 , 7370

The cheats are hilariously offensive. weakness pays and You don't deserve it. Ha! But weakness pays only spews 1k which is pretty useless unless you are just trying to survive the first part of the game. Get the BSE Funding mod if you like to just build to your hearts content like I do. 

but seriously. This game is kinda brutal without it. The only way to make a successful city is connected to the ruins of your failed cities. super slow to get money during any part of the game. Sims throw FITS if you raise taxes and are always demanding more stuff. Any amount of industrial creates bad pollution but your sims demand it so you have to scatter it thinly throughout the city and next to parks and they still demand more. Proper zoning is very nit picky. Farms create crazy water pollution. How do you even train it is useless build subways. Tolls can only be placed on avenues and highways and congests traffic badly.

"I can remember how excited I was to get SC4 Deluxe back when it first came out ...
(and I actually did get a good laugh out of 'warped regions' - the improper bit-map config files that appeared to create overlapping cities)
--- and I actually had years of play time with this game, before it came to Steam ---
--- not to mention the oversized plug-in folder, now on it's very own usb drive ---

... now it is available on Steam!

A few pet peeves with this one:[list]
[*] The SC4 terraforming tools were the new 'area effect' ones, NOT an improvement in my opinion (as an 'addition to' would have been nifty - yes, but as a 'complete replacement' ... there were times I would have liked to have the old tile-by-tile tools ... - no);
[*] Due to the dev's not understanding that elevated (already having a 'bridge' structure) transit doesn't need to use a BRIDGE to cross 'ground/surface water' (thus creating visual issues resulting from requiring a bridge to cross ANY water (in previous versions of SimCity) neither 'ground/surface water' nor hydroelectric power plants were available in SC4;
[*] The near impossible requirements to get a bridge that didn't have water somewhere below it;
[*] The way bridges were implemented didn't allow for above ground transit crossing underneath one - regardless of how much difference in elevation there might be;
[*] And Electronic Arts only officially released one (of several possible) expansion packages.[/list]
The (imo) noteworthy redeeming features include:[list]
[*] The ability for water craft (ferries, freight and leisure) to make it under a sufficiently high bridge;
[*] The stubs, in a neighbor city, that an intercity connection made - of whatever ... transit, utility, etc ... you chose to establish.
[*] The (new - for that time) 'modding' tools;
[*] As I remember it, the first SimCity to have a 64-bit version;
[*] And the bump up in available map sizes (64x64, 128x128, and -NEW- 256x256).[/list]

Tips and tricks:
1: Make sure to play the game slowly in the beginning, always try to keep a bit of profit.

2: Your sims do NOT need a firestaiton, policestation nor a hospital early in the game. theese are used mostly to make your sims more productive and making sure higher income citizens come to your city. if you put them in too early then it will leave your income well below red.

3: Why just one city? Building alot of cities and connecting them with rails, highways, ferry routes and so on is very important for the growth of not just your city but for your entire region.

"After playing simcity 2000, and 3000, this is just what I expected. Another step up.
It's takes a while to get use to the new system, but once you have it, this is a really great simcity game to play.
The driving games are not as great as I wanted, but are still a nice addition, even if a little buggy with car AIs.
Cars run right into intersections and sometimes ram you when your sirens are on, and can spawn out of no where.

If you have a newer PC, don't play this. It's not built for them. Mine crashes rarely. I run a dual core with vista and Ge Force go 7400.

It has it's flaws, but if you love simcity, and think your computer isn't too new for it, then I definitely recommend playing this!  If your computer is rather new, maybe try running it on a virtual machine?

"Beautiful.



The game contains much more content than Simcity 5, whereas there are three different city sizes, tons of cities in one region, customizable terrain without use of mods. In this edition it has a mode where you can drive cars for missions which affect your mayor rating, balance, and even unlock you new buildings. Speaking of buildings, there are a lot of them. There are tons of landmarks.
Simcity 5 allows you to increase certain land values for certain buildings directly (High wealth, medium wealth, low wealth). You can also shut down buildings.
Simcity 4 runs on a grid system, and there are straight and diagonal roads, as well as a preset street-development thing that happens when you zone a certain zone out large enough.
Simcity 4 has no sandbox mode, though. so you are limited on building without having to worry about money. You do have infact a cheat to unlock all buildings you don't deserve it and a cheat for money weaknesspays That's 1000 simoleons and riskymoney which gives you 10'000 simoleons but has a chance for an earthquake to happen.

I could go on and on, but I would be here for a long time.
Please buy this if you like building games.

Also: This game can have up to 2.1 billion people in a region, even though I do not think I will ever have a city-connected region of that scale.

The graphics are a bit dated but in a way it is also a bit of charm to the game as well. I would give Sim City 4 4.5 Hollywood Signs out of 5." , 1 , 0 , 0 , 0 , 0 , 2014-12-24 15:31:20 , 1526
"SimCity 4 Deluxe Edition gives a new feel to the SimCity series as well as offering a fun and new driving system. SC4DE, along with its predecessors, allows you to take full control of a plot of land to design your dream city. You can create world famous iconic buildings such as the Hollywood sign, London Tower, the Empire State Building, and many more! Even though you have this large amount of freedom, you also are presented the challenge of maintaining balance and order in your city.

"I cannot recommend SimCity 4 highly enough - it is an absolute must-play masterpiece for any city builder fan. Even after nearly 20 years, it remains one of the greatest examples of the genre.

The addictive, accessible gameplay makes it easy to lose hours constructing your ideal city. You'll delight in fine-tuning every little detail or just jumping right in and expanding rapidly - SimCity 4 works excellently either way. The flexible playstyles provide endless replay value.

The charming visuals and whimsical soundtrack are pure joy. This is a game oozing with personality and heart. It draws you into its toy-like, miniature world filled with possibilities.

Simply put, they don't make city builders like this anymore. The thoughtful balance of complexity and accessibility is sublime. Modern games sacrifice engaging gameplay for the sake of flashy visuals, but not SimCity 4." , 1 , 0 , 0 , 0 , 0 , 2014-11-30 23:49:07 , 2230

"Sim City 4: The game to buy when you were disapointed with the latest edition to the Sim City Franchise.

Sim City has been a game that I have grown up with, and will always hold a special place in my heart for. While the graphics are certaintly not up to todays standards, the game offers hours upon hours of fun and relaxation. 

In the game, you take on the role of the mayor of a brand new city. You have to then design and build this empty plot of land into a large, and busy city. The game is nice because it offers fun and enjoyment to all skill levels. For example, one could simply just build to build, or you could go into such minute details about your city, and try fixing all of the problems. 

I have poured many hours into this game, and highly recomend it.

But as a warning: The game does not support 1920 x 1080 res, and will occasionally crash (only crashed on my laptop, works fine on my tower)." , 1 , 0 , 0 , 0 , 0 , 2014-11-24 13:29:16 , 1478

"Hard, but that doesn't mean not good.

while simcity 3000 will remain my favorite for the rest of the conceivable future, 4 has a certain charm and depth of mechanics that makes me itch for more.

the budgeting system has been overhauled allowing for much, much more customization and indepth management of your city's utitlities, waste management, and tax revenue. whereas in 3000 you could only manage RCI taxes as a sort of umbrella for each type, in 4 you can raise and lower taxes based on the pay bracket (for commercial and residential) or the subtype (industrial, separated into agricultural, dirty industry, clean industry and high tech industry). this management allows you to pinpoint taxes where you want them, potentially driving out a class of residents or commerce, or inviting in the same.

the zoning rules have changed dramatically. whereas in 3000 you simply designate a plot of land and let the sims do the rest, in 4 each zoned lot has a facing and transportation/utilities needs that have to be met before the lot will develop. designating a large area will automatically add roads so that you don't have to micromanage each lot's transportation needs for the most part.

on the topic of transportation, roads in general have recieved an overhaul, splitting them into four classes of road, with separate capacities for travel: streets, traditional roads, avenues and highways. while the avenue, the highway, and of couse the road were availabe in 3000, the avenue was constructed by putting two roads together, and the highway was bank-breakingly overpriced. the newest addition, the street, is a low capacity form of transport that requires very little maintenance.

coming back to utility management, each utility building (water pumps, power plants, landfills) has a seperate funding slider that can be adjusted to change the output or intake of the facility in question. such a mechanic can be used to set power systems into standby, or to limit usage of over-producing plants; all very useful for a city that has just begun.

the region system is where this game really shines, however. the ability to create dozens of cities and have them all work together is simply incredible.

in short, simcity 4 is a very deep, very complicated game, but the rewards are very high. the amount of fun I've had here despite losing is roughly .75 times what I've had in 3000, which is saying something considering how much I've loved 3000.

"[b]TL;DR for bug fixes and better graphics at the bottom![/b]

First of all, please ignore my playtime. I've been playing this game since its release back in 2003, and have only recently switched from my CD copy to a steam copy. This game is, in my opinion, the best city building game out there, but I'm not going to talk about why, I'm sure other people could do a better job than me. Instead, I'm going to explain how to fully optimize this game to get the best performance and fix some common problems.

First of all, download the SC4 Launcher and the Network Addon Mod (NAM) from Simtropolis. These two mods alone will fix 99% of the game's major problems (crashing, poor performance, and poor traffic simulation).

Outside of that, a few more minor bugs (such as the Opera House & Grand Railway bugs) can be fixed with mods, and there's literally thousands of other free mods on Simtropolis ranging from new buildings, customizable parks/amusement parks, town cosmetics, and just about anything you could imagine. There's even a mod that changes the game to take place on mars! (Simmars)

Then I saw this one on Steam, so I got it, hoping that it'd at least be able to run smoothly. I was not disappointed.

To me, it took a while to adjust to the new things that needed to be managed (like supplying water and spamming the city with parks and trees and etc.) compared to SimCity Classic. Now, I can say that I'm doing a decent job running a city.

Lots of thinking and planning is involved to make a good city. It takes some time to get to that but it's rewarding once you're there. Some of the guides found online can help a lot.

One of the only things that I dislike about this game is the U-Drive it mode. I've had instances where cars would spawn where I'm at and automatically wreck the car I'm driving. There are other times where I'd drive adjacent to the edge/border of the city, and the game would think that I left the city and fail me. Other than that, everything else about the game is pretty solid.

"[h1]Still [u]the[/u] city simulator after a decade[/h1]

First, this is a [u]really complex[/u] game, similar to how running an actual city is really complex. If you don't like managing a lot of detail, then this game isn't for you. There are a lot of zones, utilities, civic structures, and transportation systems to build. It's a bit overwhelming at first, so make sure to go through the tutorials and [u]start small[/u] (e.g., low-density zones, no education system, no hospitals, and no water system). While the complexity makes it a bit hard to get into SC4, it's the same thing that's missing in SimCity Societies and SimCity (2013).

Second, unless you're playing on a Mac which gets the updated port by Aspyr, you'll have some [u]technical problems[/u] to deal with. Basically, you have to add command line parameters to tell the game to use only one of your CPU's cores and to use resolutions that didn't exist when SC4 was released (like 1920x1080). [u]Search the forums[/u] for details on recommended parameters. Once you've gotten that figured out, you might want to fiddle a bit with the graphics options (I think I reduced the shading/shadow effects to minimum). With this sorted out, the game runs pretty smoothly for me and only crashes every few hours on average. [u]Save often[/u] to be safe. I have no idea if Aspyr's planning to release a Windows version of their Mac version, but when/if they do, these technical problems should pretty much disappear.

Third, there are some [u]issues with game mechanics[/u] that make it hard to build big regions without mods. While you can do a lot without adding mods, I strongly recommend using the Network Addon Mod (NAM) and Colossus Addon Mod (CAM), at least after you reach the point where things stop working correctly. Even if you don't enable any of the NAM's custom transportation systems, it's worth it for the improved traffic simulator alone. There are [u]lots of mods[/u] for fixing other things and adding pretty much everything, so use your favorite search engine and explore. There's still a [u]really active modding community[/u] after a decade.

Overall, SimCity 4 is a great game once you put in the time to learn it and work around the technical issues. It has what's missing in the newer SimCity games and doesn't force you to be constantly online. [u]It would be really awesome if Aspyr ports their Mac port to Windows (and Linux!)[/u], fixing all the technical issues. Until then, I recommend waiting for this game to go on sale before buying it here. I got it for $5 in early 2014 to replace my CD copy that finally broke." , 1 , 0 , 0 , 0 , 0 , 2014-07-20 17:27:04 , 2020

"I'm not sure any Sim game can beat the experience of the original, which most of us came across on a computer in study hall in our middle or high school. It isn't about features, graphics or customization - just one of those times when the first iteration of a game is the most enjoyable, no matter how vast the improvements since then.

I commend SC4 for even coming CLOSE to that experience. Despite the it's not the original feeling I do find myself getting wrapped up in creating my perfect city. This game has everything you'd want out of a city builder, complete with a street view and dispatching fire trucks. 

Graphically it's pretty good. It's not awe-inspiring or offputting, just good enough to not be a distraction - which is exactly the pocket a game like this should fit into. After all, there are plenty of games to be visually struck by, that just isn't the point of a city builder. Options and control are far more important, and it exceeds expectations in leaps and bounds.

One thing I always wished was possible was differing time periods - being able to make a town with a 60's feel, or the Old West - presenting a lot of different problems, using different buildings, etc. I watch Back to the Future a lot (a lot!) so perhaps I'm alone in that.

"SimCity 4 had a lot of great things going for it at the time. It still has that spark from the 2000's, but you can't help but ask yourself 8 hours in, What's the point?. In the end, there is almost no point to any video game, but the point to SimCity is still kind of sharp.

There's an occasional freeze/bug where I have to fire up Task Manager and put it in its place, but this very rare, and virtually never for a city I've had going for a while.  An acceptable level of downtime for something I keep running alongside while I do my work.

"  Sick game if you like City Planning and Sandbox games.
There is alot to learn at first but after the tutorials, a little reasearch on strategy

enjoy this type of gameplay you'll get pretty addicted fast.

"To all residents of BCIVille:

It has come to my attention that a number of you have filed complaints regarding increasing numbers of traffic collisions, crimes and pollution. Rest assured, as mayor I am hard at work on a plan to solve all of our great city's problems at the same time. I cannot say too much right now as it's still in the planning phase, but the general idea of the BCIVille Renewal Project '14 includes an aggressive strategy of tax breaks, industry subsidies and strategic nuclear strikes in the worst areas of the city. 

As well I'm considering the possibility of using new, exotic materials to simplify our existing infrastructure in order to save our public works departments millions of dollars per year in materials compared to what we've been doing until now. I've discussed the effectiveness of this plan with my advisors and a number of constituents and they all agree: this will work. According to official reports from the BCIVille Department of Quite Reliable Statistics, we should expect to see a 58% increase in cromulence by the year 2016.

I understand some of you may have questions or concerns, and believe me, I need your input as citizens to perfect BCIVille for all of us. If you want to volunteer, please address your opinions to the following mailing address, located conveniently next to our city's landfill:

BCIVille Municipal Feedback Department

"SimCity 4 is one of my favorite city building/managment games.  I originally had the SimCity 4 Deluxe Edition on 4 CD's but after fighing with EA to get the software installed and working. I just gave up and bought the game on Steam when there had it for like $7.00. I'm glad that I purchased the game on Steam!!! As long as I have my Steam account I will always play the game.

Update 1/24/2015
Now that I have been playing SimCity 4 Deluxe Edition thru Steam I love the game more so now. I also added the following in Steam for SC4's Set Launch Options: -CustomResolution:enabled -r1600x1200x32 -d:DirectX -CPUPriority:high -CPUCount:1 -intro:off. SC4 been playing with no more crashes. 

If you want to use this setting make sure you change the following:
-r1600x1200x32 -> to match your screen ressolution
-d:DirectX -> SC4 was made for DirectX and NOT OpenGL.
-CPUPriority:high -> use this setting if you have a Dual or Quad CPU (ADM or INTEL) (remember this game is from 2003)

"This game is Mr. Turtle approved.

A classic city builder, indepth but not boring or hard to grasp in the least.
You have disasters which you can control, the game 
only generates fires as its natural disasters leaving it all up to you to level the city.

You have three zones Residential, Commercial, and Industrial. 
There is argriculture but that's just another industrial zone.
So you can make a little farming community if you wish. 
Or a bustling metropolis.

You manage water, electricity, and trash.
You may trade with a neighbor in the region.
However all the cities in the region are built by you.
You can generate simple regions and edit the terrain via each section of the entire map. 
So click a tile, load in, mess with the terrain if you please and then you get down to business and enter Mayor mode.
Gone are your god-like powers... sure.... 

It's a fun game and a must have for those who like to build cities.

Crashes were frequent and the performance was not great despite having hardware more than capable of handling it. These many years later, the game runs much more smoothly than it ever did and it's a joy to go back and play. It's complex without being irritating (I will never understand where to put bus stations to get them to work properly, though). I've played SimCity since the first game was released in the late 80s (I played it in the early 90s), and SC4 ranks high on my list - perhaps below SC2000, but slightly higher than SC3000. The beauty of SC4 is the size of the maps, the inclusion of regions and the varied building style. The customisation of terrain is also the most advanced of all of the SimCities (in the latest one, terrain editing is sadly lacking).

"SimCity 4, the last Maxis SimCity, remains the best of its genre to this day. Although it lacks the speculative technology of SimCity 2000 or the beautiful slit-scan rendering of the (perhaps unfairly infamous) 2013 revision, SC4 is thorough and rigorous in its realism and level of simulated detail. 
For example, to check the operation of the simulation at the individual level, you can create and follow sims (and their dynasties) as they travel around from home to work and back, finding jobs appropriate to their social class/level of education, to test your city's transportation grid down to the individual level of detail.
This Deluxe Edition comes with the Rush Hour expansion which adds even more detail and control options to transportation simulation. The only significant drawback is that, like previous SimCities, roads cannot truly bend or angle properly; cities consequently must be laid out more or less in a grid pattern. Of course, as Atlanta just demonstrated in Half-Inchopocalypse 2014, there are excellent reasons to avoid curving and angling roads all over the place in city planning, so this is a feature that you most likely won't miss." , 1 , 0 , 0 , 0 , 0 , 2014-02-06 08:17:16 , 829
"SimCity 4 is a fun game.  If you played simcity2000 this is the perfect successor to that game.  Pipes are simplified, water is easy and plentiful.  Power is generally easy to manage as are most the cities systems.  I didn't HAVE to cheat to win this game or even to play it the way I wanted to.  The cities seem to adapt better no matter how poorly you place zones.  
I love this game.

However....  Numerous crash issues, memory leak issues, Huge cities seem to bog down the game in ways you wouldn't expect.  (water being there then not there then there in pipes, leading to rallies about not having water then they do) My pc is far an away powerful enough to run this game, a beast machine when this game was made new. Still this game does not always work.  I would say this game is worth playing, toying around with despite it's many bad programming faults.

"This is the last Good Sim City game. 

You start with a Region, in the real world. 
You make a town in that region. 
You than make another town in that region. 
Both towns can now make deals with each other to sutain one another. 

That, is how close you can be as a State Governer if you manage to occupy every city territory in the entire region. 

There is also some early The Sims to the short lived social massivly multiplayer game Sims Online. Yeah, so if you had the origanal The Sims, you can import that charater to be an individual Blessed by the god, known as Mayor in your city. A rather unused feature. 

The only problem is people in this game don't like to use public transit, even if you forced them. Commercal zones don't quite develope or have enough demand and job creation. Also everything has to be severly under budget to stay in the green, even if the Sims go to school, they don't really go to school to justify 200 student capacity and 15 teachers when only 17 attend. It would just be cheaper with no schools and emergancy services even if the advisers piss and moan. All problems non-existant in Sim City 3000." , 1 , 1 , 0 , 0 , 0 , 2014-01-29 01:17:07 , 1444
"If you like these kind of games (strategy, economy, building the entire city, even the transports), you are late, GET THIS GAME NOW!!!
IT'S FUCKING AWESOME. 
-Hundreds of hours of play!
-It can even run on a netbook (you can hack the resolution, google it), and it doesn't lag!
-Good replayability!
-The graphics aged really well, i think they still look pretty much perfect, they don't have to be better. (i don't care about graphics in fact, but in this case, even if i cared, it aged well!)
-Thousands of mods and buildings that you can download, so these can make your games longer, better and more replayable!
-The possibilities are huge, you could make a city in the desert, in the mountains, whatever biome, and if you don't like it, you can modify the land in any way you want.
-The driving missions are sometimes hard, but it's awesome to drive in your own city, the roads you made. And it also reflects the traffic load in your city.
-The transports! There's almost anything: planes, trains, ferry, and more. And each one has its missions, and loads of vehicles.

"Simcity 4 Deluxe Edition is probably the best city builder out there. It's graphic design is timeless and soundtrack offers some best elevator music available. One of the perks of this simulation is the ability to run a whole region, not just one city, and to terraform it to your liking. One of the cons of it is the square-grid, that limits the organic look of your city, but at the same time, the city feels alive thanks to advisors, newsreels with puns, missions you can perform driving around various vehicles in the game and even ability to plant your own sims in there (that you can also import from your original Sims game, should you own one). The basic square-based layout also makes the game somewhat easier and less time consuming.

There are some SERIOUS ISSUES, that can hurt your gameplay, like crashes or jagged graphics, but these CAN BE FIXED easily when you find the right community guides. It takes just changing few lines to make the game run smooth and detailed on modern machines.

"I got a bug for this series since playing Sim City on the SNES way back. Then again, maybe it wasn't a bug as I never played any of the games apart from the SNES version and this, but I trusted the general angle of the reviews.

In short, a great game that's ages superbly. You can really soak up the hours once you get a city going and you have massive control. The 'tutorial' cities give you breathing room and you're bound to learn from your mistakes quickly when you get caught in the traps of over/under development of certain of your cities' aspects.

I'm quite rubbish at the game, but that doesn't stop it being one of the most absorbing games I've ever played (in that sense, I'd put it there with the likes of Morrowind, Zelda, FFVII, Shenmue - games that utterly took hold of me!)" , 1 , 0 , 0 , 0 , 0 , 2014-01-13 15:17:17 , 339

"I'm not as familiar as some might be with the Sim City series. The last one I played was on the SNES and compared to SC4 it definitely has it's differences. Even after 18 years of not playing, it was easy to get back into Sim City after playing through the tutorials. Being able to setup a region and build cities in different sections all across it is cool. Also liked that I can add mountains, valleys, rivers, lakes etc.. and customize the regions to my liking. The Rush hour expansion is a nice addition so I can control what kind of transportation I want in my cities and provides an extra challenge to building my cities. I've only put in a couple of sessions and I know there are so many features in this game I haven't touched on.

I would tell anyone who is looking for a strategy/simulation game then this one should be considered. I was very iffy about the newest Sim City which is why I picked this one up.

If this was released today, it would be praised for its attention to detail and vast simulation improvements over the new Simcity (2013). Basically, this game is 1/4 of the price of the newest release, and CONSIDERABLY better.

Simulation is in-depth and chock full of charts, graphs, and data overlays. Build whole, huge regions of billions of sims, with cities all interconnected to form vast metropolises. Plot sizes are up to 16x larger than the newest Simcity (2013) and they directly border their neighbours, allowing you to build a large city over the course of several plots.

"Out of the box, I'd really can't recommend SC4 Deluxe to anyone but veterans of the days when you could buy this in a store on a CD, mainly due to compatibility issues, unresolved issues in the simulation, and frequent crashes. As much as I have loved this game, it honestly doesn't hold up by itself in 2020. 

SimCity 4's saving grace is its robust, extensive, long lived mod scene. The Network Addon Mod, or NAM, is pretty much considered an essential addition to any player's collection, and thus is the best one to start with. Heap on some custom buildings and perhaps a few other mods like the Colossus Addon Mod, and SC4 itself becomes essential. 

I highly recommend Cities: Skylines as well, both to SC4 vets and new players alike. Skylines in some ways is what SimCity 5 (2013) should have been. It's amazing to note that much of what Paradox has done was inspired by good ol' SC4 Deluxe!

In summary, don't buy SC4 Deluxe for the out of the box experience. Buy it for the mods that make it an unforgettable, perhaps even life-changing experience.

One final note: Don't buy this from Origin, even if it happens to be cheaper. The Origin version is not up-to-date and does not support newer mods, like the NAM. Buy from Steam or GOG." , 1 , 0 , 0 , 0 , 0 , 2013-06-24 17:04:51 , 7679

but... school and health funding was expensive. costs of these things meant that the reserve of money slowly diminished. Jobs were lost and a new breed of crime had begun, the crime started to take over more and more of the city day by day. the police force made a hasty effort to stop the crive wave which was submerging the city, drugs became a big part of the economy, it was the only way for people to make and money, and for some the only way to survive. the crime was that bad that parts of the city least effects were sanctioned off to the rest. this was the last hope for the life of the city. but... this was no end, for what was to come..... the city wouldnt be prepared...... the buildings fall everywere as roiting and violence swept the city. countless adults and even children were majorly injurded and murderd by the crime uprising throughout the city. as the citys police forces efforts were no use.... it was to late for the city..... it all ended with the push of a putton... the bomb dropped killing more and more of the inocent.... killing those which turned agaisnt there city.... there home...... all which has been done was done at a required cost...... 

Those lost will be rememberd" , 1 , 0 , 0 , 0 , 0 , 2013-05-19 03:54:09 , 285

"A classic, and one of my all-time favourite games that even today, I occasionally revisit. Creating a working city is something I've alawys enjoyed, and in the most straightforward of ways, this old game delivers and has stood the test of time with it's fundamental attention to detail, whilst still maintaining it's clean, common-sense UI.   I've chosen to continue playing this over EA's newest incarnation, because this game works - on every level - it just works.

Have easily logged thousands of hours in this over the years and I consider it the definitive city-building title. 

Sidenote: Found it to be slightly buggy in Win 7/64 bit, but so far it's played smoothly in Win 8.1/64.

Edit March 2015:  While this might be the original, it really isn't optimized for newer OS and topping it off, Cities:Skylines has made it what it should have been today.

It has allowed me to remain calm and composed in situations that require it, and my attitude on other world-building sandbox games (like Minecraft) has improved because I take my fire-fisted griefer heart over to my Sims, instead.

"I don't know about you, but I've been hearing that the mayor rocks according to city blocks.

But in all seriousness, this game is a classic and for good reason. The city simulation that runs behind the scenes, while a bit outdated in its ideas for what good urban planning actually looks like, has yet to be matched by any successor. The region mode allows you to network individual city tiles together to form one large megaopolis, and RCI demand and transportation networks seamlessly carry over into your neighboring cities when establishing connections. It's a great idea, and really lets you build massive cities.

Biggest drawback to playing Simcity 4 nowadays is that it's notoriously difficult to get it running smoothly. As of right now, you're mostly limited to 1080p. Any higher and you'll experience bizarre graphical glitches every now and then but it's still playable overall. Modding is essential to get the full experience, but that's ok because the modding community is one of the best out there, rivaling the likes of Mount and Blade and Rimworld.

"On Exactitude in Sim City, ... In that game, the art of mapping attained such perfection that the map of a single city occupied the entirety of a zone, and the map of the region, the entirety of a city. In time, those unconscionable maps no longer satisfied, and the modding community struck a map of a region whose size was that of the region, and which coincided point for point with it. The following gaming generation, who were not so fond of the study of mapping as their forebears had been, saw that that vast map was useless, and not without some pitilessness was it, that they delivered it up to the inclemencies of incompatible versions. In the abandoned websites, still today, there are corrupted files of that map, inhabited by broken links and bugs; in all the Internet there is no other relic of the disciplines of geography. - Suárez Miranda, Viajes de jugadores prudentes, Libro IV,Cap.

New graphics and a far more efficent sim engine behind this game, makes everything just that little more rewarding once you've broken even with your funding.

"Given a second chance, and a bunch of patches a year and a half later, and this game is actually playable.

Can still be increidbly unstable on certain hardware, especially if you dont have up to date drivers.

Worth it if its on sale, since once you can actually play it it's better than citiesXL" , 1 , 0 , 0 , 0 , 1 , 2012-07-18 19:51:05 , 118
